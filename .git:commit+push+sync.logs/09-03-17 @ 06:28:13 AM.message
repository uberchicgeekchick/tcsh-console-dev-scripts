I have added support for multiple entries into git's commit message now I can use multiple command arguments to create a larger continued commit log.

This is especially useful since now my 1st commit message argument is the main part of git's commit message & so its something I can remember & actually use for checkouts, patch management, & all of git's other wonderful features.

I've also done a ton of other lil things.  I so need to commit my scripts more warning.
