	 * NOTE: Currently I'm releasing all of my software under the RPL, but I'm working
	 * on my own license focused on software writen by myself and other
	 * open source internet artists(i.e. internet programmers, developers, designers, &etc).
	 * This new liscense will focus on internet based apps.  I've far to often seen
	 * internet applications improved, modified, or even re-factored but because they're
	 * never officially `released` companies never have to release or share their code.
	 * Since I've began writing mostly internet focused apps for the last several years.
	 * Either browser based or other style apps.  I want to ensure that my intention of
	 * my software being kept in the spirit of `free as in freedom`.  As an open source
	 * developers creating internet based software.  And my software can re-coded or
	 * whatever and since it may never be `released`, code never has to be recontributed.
	 * Which is problem I want to resolve for all of my future apps.  I'd stick with RPL
	 * but it seriously restricts options when it comes to REST based &APIs for my software.
	 * If you can help contribute to this new internet based open source license
	 * please, please, pretty please contact me.
