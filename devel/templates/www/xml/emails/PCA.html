<div class="uberChicGeekChicks_message"> <strong
 class="uberChicGeekChicks_strong">*Hello,*</strong>
<p class="uberChicGeekChicks_p">I was so glad to read your posting on
Craig's List this morning.&nbsp; I'm looking for a flexible PCA, or a
team of them depending on availability, schedules, circumstances, &amp;
etc.&nbsp; What I need is a total of 17hrs assistance Per week, varying
on pay &amp; etc.&nbsp; For example hire pay means fewer hours.&nbsp;
My focus is only on getting what care I need &amp; I'd be extremely
happy to pay more for fewer hours.&nbsp; I don't need full nursing
care.&nbsp; I do need assistance with especially with cooking, meal
prep., shopping, cleaning, medications, bath prep. - but not bathing,
occasional assistance with positioning and/or transferring, &amp; misc
tasks as they come up.<br>
</p>
<p class="uberChicGeekChicks_p">A lil more details on my
situation.&nbsp; I live with Generalized Dystonia which is a movement
disorder.&nbsp; It causes continuous spasms &amp; abnormal postures
throughout my entire body.&nbsp; These spasms are extremely painful
&amp; have left me with control over my left hand alone.&nbsp; The rest
of my body's at my misfiring brain's whims.&nbsp; This includes times
when I suffer from Dystonic Storms which appear as seizures &amp; last
around hour.&nbsp; I don't need any specific help from you, all that
can be done is I'm give certain meds &amp; wear an oxygen mask until my
storm subsides.&nbsp; If that's in you comfort level it would be simple
amazing.&nbsp; Otherwise I have a lifeline system I use to call 911 for
me &amp; they are, usually, familiar with exactly what to do.<br>
</p>
<p class="uberChicGeekChicks_p">I don't have the means for a 24/7 PCA,
my care is covered my Larimer County Human Services.&nbsp; I'll be
honest, I'm pretty much desperate right now. I have one care taker,
he's a dear friend &amp; tries his best but only able to come 3 days
per wk &amp;...well I'm desperately need of more &amp; better
care.&nbsp; Aside from the hours another possible issue is that I live
in Fort Collins, but I'm more than happy to calculate your travel
expenses into your pay.&nbsp; One other possible issue, that's been a
point of contention in the past, is that I'm an active smoker.&nbsp;
Lastly, I have a history of severe physical &amp; sexual assault.&nbsp;
Its not left me with any issues that cause me to be a harm to
others.&nbsp; But there truth of the matter, and that it still effects
me, has been an issue with PCAs in the past &amp; just wanted to bring
it up.&nbsp; This has no impact on my needed care or any of my PCAs
resposibilities.&nbsp; Despite it all having been out of my control the
simply fact of that part of my past has made past care takers feel
uncomfortable, or something, but it was enough for them to quit after
becoming aware of it, so I'd rather get it out now.<br>
</p>
<p class="uberChicGeekChicks_p">I'm sorry if this email has seemed full
of 'over sharing'.&nbsp; I'm just trying to cover everything I can
think of.&nbsp; Like I mentioned I'm in a desperate situation &amp;
would rather cover everything I can think of as soon as I can, i.e.
here, to avoid any issues later.&nbsp; All of that said.&nbsp; I still
hope you're interested in to hear back from you.&nbsp; You can email me
back, though&nbsp; it would be easier if you could call me.&nbsp; My
number is 1-970-744-5343.&nbsp; With all of my online activity my inbox
is constantly over filled &amp; I'd hate to miss or delay hearing from
you an later then possible.<br>
</p>
<br>
I hope you're <strong>*uberExcellent*</strong> &amp; taking care,<br>
