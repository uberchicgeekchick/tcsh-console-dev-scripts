In this chapter, we get to start having fun, because we get to start
talking about software design.  If we're going to talk about good
software design, we have to talk about Laziness, Impatience, and
Hubris, the basis of good software design.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2179"></a>
We've all fallen into the trap of using cut-and-paste when we should
have defined a higher-level abstraction, if only just a loop or
subroutine.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a> To be sure, some folks have gone to the
opposite extreme of defining ever-growing mounds of higher-level
abstractions when they should have used cut-and-paste.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a> Generally, though,
most of us need to think about using more abstraction rather than
less.</p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-1"></a>
<p>[1] This is a form of False
Laziness.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-2"></a>
<p>[2]This is a form of False Hubris.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Caught somewhere in the middle are the people who have a balanced view
of how much abstraction is good, but who jump the gun on writing their
own abstractions when they should be reusing existing
code.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a>
</p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-3"></a>
<p>[3] You guessed it--this is False Impatience.
But if you're determined to reinvent the wheel, at least try to invent
a better one.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Whenever you're tempted to do any of these things, you need to sit
back and think about what will do the most good for you and your
neighbor over the long haul.  If you're going to pour your creative
energies into a lump of code, why not make the world a better place
while you're at it?  (Even if you're only aiming for the program to
<em class="emphasis">succeed</em>, you need to make sure it fits the right
ecological niche.)</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2180"></a>
The first step toward ecologically sustainable programming is simply this:
don't litter in the park.  When you write a chunk of code, think about
giving the code its own namespace, so that your variables and functions
don't clobber anyone else's, or vice versa.  A namespace is a bit like
your home, where you're allowed to be as messy as you like, as long as
you keep your external interface to other citizens moderately civil. In
Perl, a namespace is called a <em class="emphasis">package</em>.  Packages provide the
fundamental building block upon which the higher-level concepts of
modules and classes are constructed.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2181"></a><a name="INDEX-2182"></a><a name="INDEX-2183"></a><a name="INDEX-2184"></a>
Like the notion of "home", the notion of "package" is a bit nebulous.
Packages are independent of files.  You can have many packages in a
single file, or a single package that spans several files, just as
your home could be one small garret in a larger building (if you're a
starving artist), or it could comprise several buildings (if your name happens
to be Queen Elizabeth).  But the usual size of a home is one building,
and the usual size of a package is one file.  Perl provides some
special help for people who want to put one package in one file, as
long as you're willing to give the file the same name as the package
and use an extension of <em class="emphasis">.pm</em>, which is short for "perl
module". The <em class="emphasis">module</em> is the fundamental unit of reusability in Perl.
Indeed, the way you use a module is with the <tt class="literal">use</tt> command, which is
a compiler directive that controls the importation of subroutines and
variables from a module.  Every example of <tt class="literal">use</tt> you've seen until
now has been an example of module reuse.
<a name="INDEX-2185"></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2186"></a><a name="INDEX-2187"></a><a name="INDEX-2188"></a> The Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network, or CPAN, is where you should put your modules if
other people might find them useful.  Perl has thrived because of the
willingness of programmers to share the fruits of their labor with the
community.  Naturally, CPAN is also where you can find modules that
others have thoughtfully uploaded for everyone to use.  See <a href="ch22_01.htm">Chapter 22, "CPAN"</a>, and www.cpan.org for
details.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2189"></a><a name="INDEX-2190"></a>
The trend over the last 25 years or so has been to design computer
languages that enforce a state of paranoia.  You're expected to
program every module as if it were in a state of siege.  Certainly
there are some feudal cultures where this is appropriate, but not all
cultures are like this.  In Perl culture, for instance, you're
expected to stay out of someone's home because you weren't invited in,
not because there are bars on the windows.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</a>
</p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-4"></a>
<p>[4] But Perl
provides some bars if you want them, too.  See "Handling Insecure
Code" in <a href="ch23_01.htm">Chapter 23, "Security"</a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2191"></a>
This is not a book about object-oriented methodology, and we're not
here to convert you into a raving object-oriented zealot, even if you
want to be converted.  There are already plenty of books out there for
that. Perl's philosophy of object-oriented design fits right in with
Perl's philosophy of everything else: use object-oriented design where
it makes sense, and avoid it where it doesn't.  Your call.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2192"></a><a name="INDEX-2193"></a>
In OO-speak, every object belongs to a grouping called a <em class="emphasis">class</em>.  In
Perl, classes and packages and modules are all so closely related that
novices can often think of them as being interchangeable.  The typical

class is implemented by a module that defines a package with the
same name as the class.  We'll explain all of this in the next few chapters.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2194"></a>
When you <tt class="literal">use</tt> a module, you benefit from direct software reuse.
With classes, you benefit from indirect software reuse when one class
uses another through inheritance.  And with classes, you get something
more: a clean interface to another namespace.  Everything in a class
is accessed indirectly, insulating the class from the outside world.</p>

<p>As we mentioned in <a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, "References"</a>, object-oriented programming
in Perl is accomplished through references whose referents 
know which class they belong to.  In fact, now that you know about
references, you know almost everything difficult about objects.  The rest
of it just "lays under the fingers", as a pianist would say.  You
will need to practice a little, though.
<a name="INDEX-2195"></a><a name="INDEX-2196"></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2197"></a><a name="INDEX-2198"></a><a name="INDEX-2199"></a><a name="INDEX-2200"></a>
One of your basic finger exercises consists of learning how to protect
different chunks of code from inadvertently tampering with each
other's variables.  Every chunk of code belongs to a particular
<em class="emphasis">package</em>, which determines what variables and
subroutines are available to it.  As Perl encounters a chunk of code,
it is compiled into what we call the <em class="emphasis">current
package</em>.  The initial current package is called
"<tt class="literal">main</tt>", but you can switch the current package to
another one at any time with the <tt class="literal">package</tt>
declaration.  The current package determines which symbol table is
used to find your variables, subroutines, I/O handles, and formats.
<a name="INDEX-2201"></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2202"></a>
Any variable not declared with <tt class="literal">my</tt> is associated
with a package--even seemingly omnipresent variables like
<tt class="literal">$_</tt> and <tt class="literal">%SIG</tt>.  In fact, there's
really no such thing as a global variable in Perl, just package
variables.  (Special identifiers like <tt class="literal">_</tt> and
<tt class="literal">SIG</tt> merely seem global because they default to the
<tt class="literal">main</tt> package instead of the current one.)</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2203"></a><a name="INDEX-2204"></a><a name="INDEX-2205"></a> 
The scope of a <tt class="literal">package</tt> declaration 
is from the declaration itself
through the end of the enclosing scope (block, file, or
<tt class="literal">eval</tt>--whichever comes first) or until another
<tt class="literal">package</tt> declaration at the same level, which
supersedes the earlier one.  (This is a common practice).</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2206"></a>
All subsequent identifiers (including those declared with <tt class="literal">our</tt>, but
not including those declared with <tt class="literal">my</tt> or those qualified with a
different package name) will be placed in the symbol table belonging to
the current package.  (Variables declared with <tt class="literal">my</tt> are independent of
packages; they are always visible within, and only within, their
enclosing scope, regardless of any package declarations.)</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2207"></a>
Typically, a <tt class="literal">package</tt> declaration will be the first statement of a
file meant to be included by <tt class="literal">require</tt> or <tt class="literal">use</tt>.  But again, that's
by convention.  You can put a <tt class="literal">package</tt> declaration anywhere you can
put a statement.  You could even put it at the end of a block, in
which case it would have no effect whatsoever.  You can switch into a
package in more than one place; a package declaration merely selects
the symbol table to be used by the compiler for the rest of that
block.  (This is how a given package can span more than one file.)</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2208"></a><a name="INDEX-2209"></a><a name="INDEX-2210"></a><a name="INDEX-2211"></a>
You can refer to identifiers<a href="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a> in other packages by prefixing
("qualifying") the identifier with the package name and a double
colon: <tt class="literal">$Package::Variable</tt>.  If the package name is null, the
<tt class="literal">main</tt> package is assumed.  That is, <tt class="literal">$::sail</tt> is equivalent to
<tt class="literal">$main::sail</tt>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a>
</p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-5"></a>
<p>[5] By identifiers, we mean the
names used as symbol table keys for accessing scalar variables, array
variables, hash variables, subroutines, file or directory handles, and
formats.  Syntactically speaking, labels are also identifiers, but
they aren't put into a particular symbol table; rather, they are
attached directly to the statements in your program.  Labels cannot be
package qualified.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-6"></a>
<p>[6] To clear up another bit of potential
confusion, in a variable name like <tt class="literal">$main::sail</tt>, we use the term
"identifier" to talk about <tt class="literal">main</tt> and <tt class="literal">sail</tt>, but not <tt class="literal">main::sail</tt>.
We call that a variable name instead, because identifiers cannot
contain colons.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2212"></a><a name="INDEX-2213"></a>
The old package delimiter was a single quote, so in old Perl programs
you'll see variables like <tt class="literal">$main'sail</tt> and <tt class="literal">$somepack'horse</tt>.  But
the double colon is now the preferred delimiter, in part because it's
more readable to humans, and in part because it's more readable to
<em class="emphasis">emacs</em> macros.  It also makes C++ programmers feel like they know
what's going on--as opposed to using the single quote as the separator,
which was there to make Ada programmers feel like they knew what's
going on.  Because the old-fashioned syntax is still supported for
backward compatibility, if you try to use a string like <tt class="literal">"This is
$owner's house"</tt>, you'll be accessing
<tt class="literal">$owner::s</tt>; that is, the <tt class="literal">$s</tt>
variable in package <tt class="literal">owner</tt>, which is probably not what you meant.
Use braces to disambiguate, as in <tt class="literal">"This is ${owner}'s house"</tt>.</p>

<p>The double colon can be used to chain together identifiers in a package
name: <tt class="literal">$Red::Blue::var</tt>.  This means the <tt class="literal">$var</tt> belonging to the
<tt class="literal">Red::Blue</tt> package.  The <tt class="literal">Red::Blue</tt> package has nothing to do with
any <tt class="literal">Red</tt> or <tt class="literal">Blue</tt> packages that might happen to exist.  That is, a
relationship between <tt class="literal">Red::Blue</tt> and <tt class="literal">Red</tt> or <tt class="literal">Blue</tt> may have
meaning to the person writing or using the program, but it means
nothing to Perl.  (Well, other than the fact that, in the current
implementation, the symbol table <tt class="literal">Red::Blue</tt> happens to be stored in
the symbol table <tt class="literal">Red</tt>.  But the Perl language makes no use of that
directly.)</p>

<p>For this reason, every <tt class="literal">package</tt> declaration must declare a complete
package name.  No package name ever assumes any kind of implied
"prefix", even if (seemingly) declared within the scope of some other
package declaration.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2214"></a><a name="INDEX-2215"></a><a name="INDEX-2216"></a>
Only identifiers (names starting with letters or an underscore) are
stored in a package's symbol table.  All other symbols are kept in the
<tt class="literal">main</tt> package, including all the nonalphabetic
variables, like <tt class="literal">$!</tt>, <tt class="literal">$?</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">$_</tt>.  In addition, when unqualified, the
identifiers <tt class="literal">STDIN</tt>, <tt class="literal">STDOUT</tt>,
<tt class="literal">STDERR</tt>, <tt class="literal">ARGV</tt>,
<tt class="literal">ARGVOUT</tt>, <tt class="literal">ENV</tt>,
<tt class="literal">INC</tt>, and <tt class="literal">SIG</tt> are forced to be in
package <tt class="literal">main</tt>, even when used for other purposes
than their built-in ones.  Don't name your package
<tt class="literal">m</tt>, <tt class="literal">s</tt>, <tt class="literal">y</tt>,
<tt class="literal">tr</tt>, <tt class="literal">q</tt>, <tt class="literal">qq</tt>,
<tt class="literal">qr</tt>, <tt class="literal">qw</tt>, or <tt class="literal">qx</tt>
unless you're looking for a lot of trouble.  For instance, you won't
be able to use the qualified form of an identifier as a filehandle
because it will be interpreted instead as a pattern match, a
substitution, or a transliteration.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2217"></a>
Long ago, variables beginning with an underscore were forced into the
<tt class="literal">main</tt> package, but we decided it was more useful for
package writers to be able to use a leading underscore to indicate
semi-private identifiers meant for internal use by that package only.
(Truly private variables can be declared as file-scoped lexicals, but
that works best when the package and module have a one-to-one
relationship, which is common but not required.)</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2218"></a>
The <tt class="literal">%SIG</tt> hash (which is for trapping signals; see
<a href="ch16_01.htm">Chapter 16, "Interprocess Communication"</a>) is also
special.  If you define a signal handler as a string, it's assumed to
refer to a subroutine in the <tt class="literal">main</tt> package unless
another package name is explicitly used.  Use a fully qualified signal
handler name if you want to specify a particular package, or avoid
strings entirely by assigning a typeglob or a function reference
instead:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">$SIG{QUIT} = "Pkg::quit_catcher"; # fully qualified handler name
$SIG{QUIT} = "quit_catcher";      # implies "main::quit_catcher"
$SIG{QUIT} = *quit_catcher;       # forces current package's sub
$SIG{QUIT} = \&amp;quit_catcher;      # forces current package's sub
$SIG{QUIT} = sub { print "Caught SIGQUIT\n" };   # anonymous sub</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name="INDEX-2219"></a>
The notion of "current package" is both a compile-time and run-time
concept.  Most variable name lookups happen at compile time, but
run-time lookups happen when symbolic references are dereferenced, and
also when new bits of code are parsed under <tt class="literal">eval</tt>.
In particular, when you <tt class="literal">eval</tt> a string, Perl knows
which package the <tt class="literal">eval</tt> was invoked in and
propagates that package inward when evaluating the string.  (You can
always switch to a different package inside the
<tt class="literal">eval</tt> string, of course, since an
<tt class="literal">eval</tt> string counts as a block, just like a file
loaded in with <tt class="literal">do</tt>, <tt class="literal">require</tt>, or
<tt class="literal">use</tt>.)</p>

<p>Alternatively, if an <tt class="literal">eval</tt> wants to find out what package it's in,
the special symbol <tt class="literal">__PACKAGE__</tt> contains the current package name.  Since
you can treat it as a string, you could use it in a symbolic reference
to access a package variable.  But if you were doing that, chances are
you should have declared the variable with <tt class="literal">our</tt> instead so it could
be accessed as if it were a lexical.</p>


<h2 class="sect1">10.1. Symbol Tables</h2>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2220"></a><a name="INDEX-2221"></a><a name="INDEX-2222"></a><a name="INDEX-2223"></a>
The contents of a package are collectively called a <em class="emphasis">symbol table</em>.
Symbol tables are stored in a hash whose name is the same as the
package, but with two colons appended.  The <tt class="literal">main</tt> symbol table's name
is thus <tt class="literal">%main::</tt>.  Since <tt class="literal">main</tt> also happens to be the default
package, Perl provides <tt class="literal">%::</tt> as an abbreviation for <tt class="literal">%main::</tt>.</p>

<p>Likewise, the symbol table for the <tt class="literal">Red::Blue</tt> package is named
<tt class="literal">%Red::Blue::</tt>.  As it happens, the <tt class="literal">main</tt> symbol table contains all
other top-level symbol tables, including itself, so <tt class="literal">%Red::Blue::</tt> is
also <tt class="literal">%main::Red::Blue::</tt>.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2224"></a><a name="INDEX-2225"></a>
When we say that a symbol table "contains" another symbol table, we
mean that it contains a reference to the other symbol table.  Since
<tt class="literal">main</tt> is the top-level package, it contains a reference to itself, with
the result that <tt class="literal">%main::</tt> is the same as <tt class="literal">%main::main::</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">%main::main::main::</tt>, and so on, ad infinitum. It's important to
check for this special case if you write code that traverses all symbol
tables.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2226"></a><a name="INDEX-2227"></a><a name="INDEX-2228"></a>
Inside a symbol table's hash, each key/value pair matches a variable
name to its value.  The keys are the symbol identifiers, and the
values are the corresponding typeglobs.  So when you use the
<tt class="literal">*</tt><em class="replaceable">NAME</em> typeglob notation,
you're really just accessing a value in the hash that holds the
current package's symbol table.  In fact, the following have (nearly)
the same effect:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">*sym = *main::variable;
*sym = $main::{"variable"};</pre>
</blockquote>

The first is more efficient because the <tt class="literal">main</tt> symbol table is
accessed at compile time.  It will also create a new typeglob by that
name if none previously exists, whereas the second form will not.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2229"></a><a name="INDEX-2230"></a>
Since a package is a hash, you can look up the keys of the package and
get to all the variables of the package.  Since the values of the hash
are typeglobs, you can dereference them in several ways.  Try this:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">foreach $symname (sort keys %main::) {
    local *sym = $main::{$symname};
    print "\$$symname is defined\n" if defined $sym;
    print "\@$symname is nonnull\n" if         @sym;
    print "\%$symname is nonnull\n" if         %sym;

<a name="INDEX-2231"></a>
Since all packages are accessible (directly or indirectly) through the
<tt class="literal">main</tt> package, you can write Perl code to visit
every package variable in your program.  The Perl debugger does
precisely that when you ask it to dump all your variables with the
<tt class="literal">V</tt> command.  Note that if you do this, you won't see
variables declared with <tt class="literal">my</tt> since those are
independent of packages, although you will see variables declared with
<tt class="literal">our</tt>.  See <a href="ch20_01.htm">Chapter 20, "The Perl Debugger"</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier we said that only identifiers are stored in packages other than
<tt class="literal">main</tt>.  That was a bit of a fib: you can use any string you want as the
key in a symbol table hash--it's just that it wouldn't be valid Perl if
you tried to use a non-identifier directly:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">$!@#$%           = 0;         # WRONG, syntax error.
${'!@#$%'}       = 1;         # Ok, though unqualified.

${'main::!@#$%'} = 2;         # Can qualify within the string.
print ${ $main::{'!@#$%'} }   # Ok, prints 2!</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name="INDEX-2232"></a>
Assignment to a typeglob performs an aliasing operation; that is,
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">*dick = *richard;</pre>
</blockquote>

causes variables, subroutines, formats, and file and directory handles
accessible via the identifier <tt class="literal">richard</tt> to also be
accessible via the symbol <tt class="literal">dick</tt>.  If you want to
alias only a particular variable or subroutine, assign a reference
instead:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">*dick = \$richard;</pre>
</blockquote>

That makes <tt class="literal">$richard</tt> and <tt class="literal">$dick</tt> the same variable, but leaves
<tt class="literal">@richard</tt> and <tt class="literal">@dick</tt> as separate arrays.  Tricky, eh?</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2233"></a>
This is how the <tt class="literal">Exporter</tt> works when importing symbols from one
package to another. For example:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">*SomePack::dick = \&amp;OtherPack::richard;</pre>
</blockquote>

imports the <tt class="literal">&amp;richard</tt> function from package <tt class="literal">OtherPack</tt> into
<tt class="literal">SomePack</tt>, making it available as the <tt class="literal">&amp;dick</tt> function.  (The
<tt class="literal">Exporter</tt> module is described in the next chapter.)  If you
precede the assignment with a <tt class="literal">local</tt>, the aliasing will only last as
long as the current dynamic scope.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2234"></a><a name="INDEX-2235"></a>
This mechanism may be used to retrieve a reference from a subroutine,
making the referent available as the appropriate data type:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">*units = populate() ;         # Assign \%newhash to the typeglob
print $units{kg};             # Prints 70; no dereferencing needed!

sub populate {
    my %newhash = (km =&gt; 10, kg =&gt; 70);
    return \%newhash;
}</pre>
</blockquote>

Likewise, you can pass a reference into a subroutine and use it
without dereferencing:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">%units = (miles =&gt; 6, stones =&gt; 11);  
fillerup( \%units );          # Pass in a reference
print $units{quarts};         # Prints 4

sub fillerup {
    local *hashsym = shift;   # Assign \%units to the typeglob
    $hashsym{quarts} = 4;     # Affects %units; no dereferencing needed!
}</pre>
</blockquote>

These are tricky ways to pass around references cheaply when you don't
want to have to explicitly dereference them.  Note that both
techniques only work with package variables; they would not have
worked had we declared <tt class="literal">%units</tt> with
<tt class="literal">my</tt>.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2236"></a><a name="INDEX-2237"></a><a name="INDEX-2238"></a><a name="INDEX-2239"></a>
Another use of symbol tables is for making "constant" scalars:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">*PI = \3.14159265358979;</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name="INDEX-2240"></a><a name="INDEX-2241"></a>
Now you cannot alter <tt class="literal">$PI</tt>, which is probably a good
thing, all in all.  This isn't the same as a constant subroutine,
which is optimized at compile time.  A constant subroutine is one
prototyped to take no arguments and to return a constant expression;
see <a href="ch06_04.htm#ch06-sect-icf">Section 10.4.1, "Inlining Constant Functions"</a> in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Subroutines"</a>, for details.  The <tt class="literal">use
constant</tt> pragma (see <a href="ch31_01.htm">Chapter 31, "Pragmatic Modules"</a>) is a convenient shorthand:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">use constant PI =&gt; 3.14159;</pre>
</blockquote>

Under the hood, this uses the subroutine slot of
<tt class="literal">*PI</tt>, instead of the scalar slot used earlier.  It's
equivalent to the more compact (but less readable):
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">*PI = sub () { 3.14159 };</pre>
</blockquote>

That's a handy idiom to know anyway--assigning a <tt class="literal">sub
{}</tt> to a typeglob is the way to give a name to an anonymous
subroutine at run time.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2242"></a><a name="INDEX-2243"></a>
Assigning a typeglob reference to another typeglob (<tt class="literal">*sym =
\*oldvar</tt>) is the same as assigning the entire typeglob,
because Perl automatically dereferences the typeglob reference for
you.  And when you set a typeglob to a simple string, you get the
entire typeglob named by that string, because Perl looks up the string
in the current symbol table.  The following are all equivalent to one
another, though the first two compute the symbol table entry at
compile time, while the last two do so at run time:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">*sym =   *oldvar;
*sym =  \*oldvar;       # autodereference
*sym = *{"oldvar"};     # explicit symbol table lookup
*sym =   "oldvar";      # implicit symbol table lookup</pre>
</blockquote>

When you perform any of the following assignments, you're replacing just
one of the references within the typeglob:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">*sym = \$frodo;
*sym = \@sam;
*sym = \%merry;
*sym = \&amp;pippin;</pre>
</blockquote>

If you think about it sideways, the typeglob itself can be viewed as a
kind of hash, with entries for the different variable types in it.  In
this case, the keys are fixed, since a typeglob can contain exactly one
scalar, one array, one hash, and so on.  But you can pull out the
individual references, like this:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">*pkg::sym{SCALAR}      # same as \$pkg::sym
*pkg::sym{ARRAY}       # same as \@pkg::sym
*pkg::sym{HASH}        # same as \%pkg::sym
*pkg::sym{CODE}        # same as \&amp;pkg::sym
*pkg::sym{GLOB}        # same as \*pkg::sym
*pkg::sym{IO}          # internal file/dir handle, no direct equivalent
*pkg::sym{NAME}        # "sym" (not a reference)
*pkg::sym{PACKAGE}     # "pkg" (not a reference)</pre>
</blockquote>

You can say <tt class="literal">*foo{PACKAGE}</tt> and
<tt class="literal">*foo{NAME}</tt> to find out what name and package the
<tt class="literal">*foo</tt> symbol table entry comes from.  This may be
useful in a subroutine that is passed typeglobs as arguments:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">sub identify_typeglob {
    my $glob = shift;
    print 'You gave me ', *{$glob}{PACKAGE}, '::', *{$glob}{NAME}, "\n";
}

identify_typeglob(*foo);
identify_typeglob(*bar::glarch);</pre>
</blockquote>

This prints:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">You gave me main::foo
You gave me bar::glarch</pre>
</blockquote>

The
<tt class="literal">*foo{</tt><em class="replaceable">THING</em><tt class="literal">}</tt>
notation can be used to obtain references to individual elements of
<tt class="literal">*foo</tt>.  See the section <a href="ch08_02.htm#ch08-sect-str">Section 10.2.5, "Symbol Table References"</a> in
<a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, "References"</a> for details.</p>

<p>This syntax is primarily used to get at the internal filehandle or
directory handle reference, because the other internal references are
already accessible in other ways.  (The old
<tt class="literal">*foo{FILEHANDLE}</tt> is still supported to mean
<tt class="literal">*foo{IO}</tt>, but don't let its name fool you into
thinking it can distinguish filehandles from directory handles.)  But
we thought we'd generalize it because it looks kind of pretty.  Sort
of.  You probably don't need to remember all this unless you're
planning to write another Perl debugger.</p>
