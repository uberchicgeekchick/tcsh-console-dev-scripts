<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Unlike many revision control systems, the concepts upon which Mercurial is built are simple enough that it&#x2019;s easy to understand
how the software really works. Knowing this certainly isn&#x2019;t necessary, but I find it useful to have a &#x201C;mental model&#x201D; of what&#x2019;s
going on.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   This understanding gives me confidence that Mercurial has been carefully designed to be both <span

importantly, if it&#x2019;s easy for me to retain a good idea of what the software is doing when I perform a revision control task, I&#x2019;m
less likely to be surprised by its behaviour.

the <a

<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >The revlog provides efficient storage of revisions using a <span 
class="ptmri7t-">delta </span>mechanism. Instead of storing a complete copy of a file for each
revision, it stores the changes needed to transform an older revision into the new revision. For many kinds of file data, these
deltas are typically a fraction of a percent of the size of a full copy of a file.
</p><!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   Some obsolete revision control systems can only work with deltas of text files. They must either store binary files as
complete snapshots or encoded into a text representation, both of which are wasteful approaches. Mercurial can efficiently
handle deltas of files with arbitrary binary contents; it doesn&#x2019;t need to treat text as special.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.2.2    </span> <a

<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >Mercurial only ever <span 
class="ptmri7t-">appends </span>data to the end of a revlog file. It never modifies a section of a file after it has written it. This is
both more robust and efficient than schemes that need to modify or rewrite data.
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   In addition, Mercurial treats every write as part of a <span 
class="ptmri7t-">transaction </span>that can span a number of files. A transaction is <span 
class="ptmri7t-">atomic</span>:
either the entire transaction succeeds and its effects are all visible to readers in one go, or the whole thing is undone. This
guarantee of atomicity means that if you&#x2019;re running two copies of Mercurial, where one is reading data and one is writing it, the
reader will never see a partially written result that might confuse it.
</p><!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >   The fact that Mercurial only appends to files makes it easier to provide this transactional guarantee. The easier it is to do
stuff like this, the more confident you should be that it&#x2019;s done correctly.

<!--l. 134--><p class="noindent" >Mercurial cleverly avoids a pitfall common to all earlier revision control systems: the problem of <span 
class="ptmri7t-">inefficient retrieval</span>. Most
revision control systems store the contents of a revision as an incremental series of modifications against a &#x201C;snapshot&#x201D;. To
reconstruct a specific revision, you must first read the snapshot, and then every one of the revisions between the snapshot and
your target revision. The more history that a file accumulates, the more revisions you must read, hence the longer it takes to
reconstruct a particular revision.

<!--l. 151--><p class="indent" >   The innovation that Mercurial applies to this problem is simple but effective. Once the cumulative amount of delta
information stored since the last snapshot exceeds a fixed threshold, it stores a new snapshot (compressed, of course), instead of
another delta. This makes it possible to reconstruct <span 
class="ptmri7t-">any </span>revision of a file quickly. This approach works so well that it has since
been copied by several other revision control systems.
</p><!--l. 159--><p class="indent" >   Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x8-730013">4.3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:concepts:snapshot --></a> illustrates the idea. In an entry in a revlog&#x2019;s index file, Mercurial stores the range of entries from the data file that
it must read to reconstruct a particular revision.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x8-740004.2.3"></a>Aside: the influence of video compression</h5>
<!--l. 165--><p class="noindent" >If you&#x2019;re familiar with video compression or have ever watched a TV feed through a digital cable or satellite service, you may
know that most video compression schemes store each frame of video as a delta against its predecessor frame. In addition, these
schemes use &#x201C;lossy&#x201D; compression techniques to increase the compression ratio, so visual errors accumulate over the course of a
number of inter-frame deltas.
</p><!--l. 173--><p class="indent" >   Because it&#x2019;s possible for a video stream to &#x201C;drop out&#x201D; occasionally due to signal glitches, and to limit the accumulation of
artefacts introduced by the lossy compression process, video encoders periodically insert a complete frame (called a &#x201C;key
frame&#x201D;) into the video stream; the next delta is generated against that frame. This means that if the video signal gets interrupted,
it will resume once the next key frame is received. Also, the accumulation of encoding errors restarts anew with each key
frame.

 id="x8-750004.2.4"></a>Identification and strong integrity</h4>
<!--l. 184--><p class="noindent" >Along with delta or snapshot information, a revlog entry contains a cryptographic hash of the data that it represents. This makes
it difficult to forge the contents of a revision, and easy to detect accidental corruption.
</p><!--l. 189--><p class="indent" >   Hashes provide more than a mere check against corruption; they are used as the identifiers for revisions. The changeset
identification hashes that you see as an end user are from revisions of the changelog. Although filelogs and the manifest also
use hashes, Mercurial only uses these behind the scenes.
</p><!--l. 195--><p class="indent" >   Mercurial verifies that hashes are correct when it retrieves file revisions and when it pulls changes from another repository.
If it encounters an integrity problem, it will complain and stop whatever it&#x2019;s doing.
</p><!--l. 200--><p class="indent" >   In addition to the effect it has on retrieval efficiency, Mercurial&#x2019;s use of periodic snapshots makes it more robust against
partial data corruption. If a revlog becomes partly corrupted due to a hardware error or system bug, it&#x2019;s often possible to
reconstruct some or most revisions from the uncorrupted sections of the revlog, both before and after the corrupted section.
This would not be possible with a delta-only storage model.

Mercurial behaves in the same way as I outlined above. The parents of the working directory become the parents of
the new changeset. This new changeset has no children, so it becomes the new tip. And the repository now
contains two changesets that have no children; we call these <span

read a pointer to a partially written manifest revision from the changelog, and it will never read a pointer to a partially written

<!--l. 485--><p class="noindent" >The read/write ordering and atomicity guarantees mean that Mercurial never needs to <span 
class="ptmri7t-">lock </span>a repository when it&#x2019;s reading data,
even if the repository is being written to while the read is occurring. This has a big effect on scalability; you can have an
arbitrary number of Mercurial processes safely reading data from a repository safely all at once, no matter whether it&#x2019;s being
written to or not.
</p><!--l. 492--><p class="indent" >   The lockless nature of reading means that if you&#x2019;re sharing a repository on a multi-user system, you don&#x2019;t need to grant
other local users permission to <span 
class="ptmri7t-">write </span>to your repository in order for them to be able to clone it or pull changes from it; they only
need <span 
class="ptmri7t-">read </span>permission. (This is <span 
class="ptmri7t-">not </span>a common feature among revision control systems, so don&#x2019;t take it for granted!
Most require readers to be able to lock a repository to access it safely, and this requires write permission on
at least one directory, which of course makes for all kinds of nasty and annoying security and administrative
problems.)
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
</p><!--l. 503--><p class="indent" >   Mercurial uses locks to ensure that only one process can write to a repository at a time (the locking mechanism is safe even
over filesystems that are notoriously hostile to locking, such as NFS). If a repository is locked, a writer will wait for a
while to retry if the repository becomes unlocked, but if the repository remains locked for too long, the process
attempting to write will time out after a while. This means that your daily automated scripts won&#x2019;t get stuck
forever and pile up if a system crashes unnoticed, for example. (Yes, the timeout is configurable, from zero to
infinity.)

<!--l. 515--><p class="noindent" >As with revision data, Mercurial doesn&#x2019;t take a lock to read the dirstate file; it does acquire a lock to write it. To avoid the
possibility of reading a partially written copy of the dirstate file, Mercurial writes to a file with a unique name in the same
directory as the dirstate file, then renames the temporary file atomically to <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">dirstate</span>. The file named <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">dirstate </span>is thus
guaranteed to be complete, not partially written.

 id="x8-870004.5.4"></a>Avoiding seeks</h4>
<!--l. 525--><p class="noindent" >Critical to Mercurial&#x2019;s performance is the avoidance of seeks of the disk head, since any seek is far more expensive than even a
comparatively large read operation.
</p><!--l. 529--><p class="indent" >   This is why, for example, the dirstate is stored in a single file. If there were a dirstate file per directory that Mercurial
tracked, the disk would seek once per directory. Instead, Mercurial reads the entire single dirstate file in one
step.
</p><!--l. 534--><p class="indent" >   Mercurial also uses a &#x201C;copy on write&#x201D; scheme when cloning a repository on local storage. Instead of copying every revlog
file from the old repository into the new repository, it makes a &#x201C;hard link&#x201D;, which is a shorthand way to say &#x201C;these two names
point to the same file&#x201D;. When Mercurial is about to write to one of a revlog&#x2019;s files, it checks to see if the number of names
pointing at the file is greater than one. If it is, more than one repository is using the file, so Mercurial makes a new copy of the
file that is private to this repository.
</p><!--l. 544--><p class="indent" >   A few revision control developers have pointed out that this idea of making a complete private copy of a file is not very
efficient in its use of storage. While this is true, storage is cheap, and this method gives the highest performance while
deferring most book-keeping to the operating system. An alternative scheme would most likely reduce performance
and increase the complexity of the software, each of which is much more important to the &#x201C;feel&#x201D; of day-to-day
use.

<!--l. 554--><p class="noindent" >Because Mercurial doesn&#x2019;t force you to tell it when you&#x2019;re modifying a file, it uses the dirstate to store some extra information
so it can determine efficiently whether you have modified a file. For each file in the working directory, it stores the time that it
last modified the file itself, and the size of the file at that time.

class="pcrr7tn-">hg copy</span>&#x201D; files, Mercurial updates the dirstate so that it
knows what to do with those files when you commit.
</p><!--l. 564--><p class="indent" >   When Mercurial is checking the states of files in the working directory, it first checks a file&#x2019;s modification time. If that has
not changed, the file must not have been modified. If the file&#x2019;s size has changed, the file must have been modified. If the
modification time has changed, but the size has not, only then does Mercurial need to read the actual contents of the file to
see if they&#x2019;ve changed. Storing these few extra pieces of information dramatically reduces the amount of data
that Mercurial needs to read, which yields large performance improvements compared to other revision control
systems.
