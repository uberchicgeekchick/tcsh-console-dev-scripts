<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >Distributed revision control is a relatively new territory, and has thus far grown due to people&#x2019;s willingness to strike out into
ill-charted territory.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   I am writing a book about distributed revision control because I believe that it is an important subject that deserves a field
guide. I chose to write about Mercurial because it is the easiest tool to learn the terrain with, and yet it scales to the demands of
real, challenging environments where many other revision control tools fail.
</p>
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1    </span> <a 
 id="x4-40000.1"></a>This book is a work in progress</h3>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >I am releasing this book while I am still writing it, in the hope that it will prove useful to others. I also hope that readers will
contribute as they see fit.
</p><!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.2    </span> <a 
 id="x4-50000.2"></a>About the examples in this book</h3>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >This book takes an unusual approach to code samples. Every example is &#x201C;live&#x201D;&#x2014;each one is actually the result of a
shell script that executes the Mercurial commands you see. Every time an image of the book is built from its
sources, all the example scripts are automatically run, and their current results compared against their expected
results.
</p><!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   The advantage of this approach is that the examples are always accurate; they describe <span 
class="ptmri7t-">exactly </span>the behaviour of the version
of Mercurial that&#x2019;s mentioned at the front of the book. If I update the version of Mercurial that I&#x2019;m documenting, and the output
of some command changes, the build fails.
</p><!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   There is a small disadvantage to this approach, which is that the dates and times you&#x2019;ll see in examples tend to be
&#x201C;squashed&#x201D; together in a way that they wouldn&#x2019;t be if the same commands were being typed by a human. Where a human can
issue no more than one command every few seconds, with any resulting timestamps correspondingly spread out, my automated
example scripts run many commands in one second.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   As an instance of this, several consecutive commits in an example can show up as having occurred during the same second.
You can see this occur in the <a 
 id="dx4-5001"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">bisect </span>example in section&#x00A0;<a 
href="hgbookch9.html#x13-1880009.5">9.5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:undo:bisect --></a>, for instance.
</p><!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   So when you&#x2019;re reading examples, don&#x2019;t place too much weight on the dates or times you see in the output of commands.
But <span 
class="ptmri7t-">do </span>be confident that the behaviour you&#x2019;re seeing is consistent and reproducible.
