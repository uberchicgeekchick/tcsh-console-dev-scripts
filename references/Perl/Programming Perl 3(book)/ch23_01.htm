Whether you're dealing with a user sitting at the keyboard typing
commands or someone sending information across the network, you need
to be careful about the data coming into your programs, since the other
person may, either maliciously or accidentally, send you data that will
do more harm than good.  Perl provides a special security-checking
mechanism called <em class="emphasis">taint mode</em>, whose purpose is to isolate tainted
data so that you won't use it to do something you didn't intend to do.
For instance, if you mistakenly trust a tainted filename, you might end
up appending an entry to your password file when you thought you were
appending to a log file.  The mechanism of tainting is covered in
the section <a href="ch23_01.htm#ch23-sect-hid">Section 23.1, "Handling Insecure Data"</a>.</p>

<p>In multitasking environments, offstage actions by unseen actors can
affect the security of your own program.  If you presume exclusive ownership of external
objects (especially files) as though yours were the only process
on the system, you expose yourself to errors substantially subtler
than those that come from directly handling data or code of dubious
provenance.  Perl helps you out a little here by detecting some
situations that are beyond your control, but for those that you can
control, the key is understanding which approaches are proof against
unseen meddlers.  The section <a href="ch23_02.htm#ch23-sect-htg">Section 23.2, "Handling Timing Glitches"</a> discusses
these matters.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-3953"></a>
If the data you get from a stranger happens to be a bit of source code
to execute, you need to be even more careful than you would with their
data.  Perl provides checks to intercept stealthy code masquerading as
data so you don't execute it unintentionally.  If you do want to
execute foreign code, though, the <tt class="literal">Safe</tt> module lets you quarantine
suspect code where it can't do any harm and might possibly do some
good.  These are the topics of the section <a href="ch23_03.htm#ch23-sect-hic">Section 23.3, "Handling Insecure Code"</a>.</p>


<h2 class="sect1">23.1. Handling Insecure Data</h2>

<a name="INDEX-3954"></a><a name="INDEX-3955"></a><a name="INDEX-3956"></a>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-3957"></a><a name="INDEX-3958"></a><a name="INDEX-3959"></a><a name="INDEX-3960"></a>
Perl makes it easy to program securely even when your program is being
used by someone less trustworthy than the program itself.  That is,
some programs need to grant limited privileges to their users, without
giving away other privileges.  Setuid and setgid programs fall into
this category on Unix, as do programs running in various privileged
modes on other operating systems that support such notions.  Even on
systems that don't, the same principle applies to network servers and
to any programs run by those servers (such as CGI scripts, mailing
list processors, and daemons listed in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/inetd.conf</em>). All such
programs require a higher level of scrutiny than normal.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-3961"></a>
Even programs run from the command line are sometimes good candidates
for taint mode, especially if they're meant to be run by a privileged
user.  Programs that act upon untrusted data, like those that generate
statistics from log files or use <tt class="literal">LWP::*</tt> or
<tt class="literal">Net::*</tt> to fetch remote data, should probably run
with tainting explicitly turned on; programs that are not prudent risk
being turned into "Trojan horses".  Since programs don't get any kind
of thrill out of risk taking, there's no particular reason for them
not to be careful.</p>

<p>Compared with Unix command-line shells, which are really just
frameworks for calling other programs, Perl is easy to program
securely because it's straightforward and self-contained.  Unlike
most shell programming languages, which are based on multiple,
mysterious substitution passes on each line of the script, Perl
uses a more conventional evaluation scheme with fewer hidden snags.
Additionally, because the language has more built-in functionality,
it can rely less upon external (and possibly untrustworthy) programs
to accomplish its purposes.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-3962"></a><a name="INDEX-3963"></a><a name="INDEX-3964"></a><a name="INDEX-3965"></a><a name="INDEX-3966"></a>
Under Unix, Perl's home town, the preferred way to compromise system
security was to cajole a privileged program into doing something it
wasn't supposed to do.  To stave off such attacks, Perl developed a
unique approach for coping with hostile environments.  Perl
automatically enables taint mode whenever it detects its program
running with differing real and effective user or group
IDs.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a> Even if the
file containing your Perl script doesn't have the setuid or setgid
bits turned on, that script can still find itself executing in taint
mode.  This happens if your script was invoked by another program that
was <em class="emphasis">itself</em> running under differing IDs.  Perl
programs that weren't designed to operate under taint mode tend to
expire prematurely when caught violating safe tainting policy.  This

is just as well, since these are the sorts of shenanigans that were
historically perpetrated on shell scripts to compromise system
security.  Perl isn't that gullible.</p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-1"></a>
<p>[1] The setuid bit in Unix permissions is mode 04000,
and the setgid bit is 02000; either or both may be set to grant the
user of the program some of the privileges of the owner (or owners) of
the program.  (These are collectively known as set-id programs.) Other
operating systems may confer special privileges on programs in other
ways, but the principle is the same.</p>

</blockquote>

You can also enable taint mode explicitly with the <span class="option">-T</span> command-line
switch.  You should do this for daemons, servers, and any programs that
run on behalf of someone else, such as CGI scripts.  Programs that can
be run remotely and anonymously by anyone on the Net are executing in the
most hostile of environments.  You should not be afraid to say "No!"
occasionally.  Contrary to popular belief, you can exercise a great
deal of prudence without dehydrating into a wrinkled prude.</p>

<p>On the more security-conscious sites, running all CGI scripts under
the <span class="option">-T</span> flag isn't just a good a idea: it's the law.  We're not
claiming that running in taint mode is sufficient to make your
script secure.  It's not, and it would take a whole book just to
mention everything that would.  But if you aren't executing your
CGI scripts under taint mode, you've needlessly abandoned the
strongest protection Perl can give you.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-3972"></a><a name="INDEX-3973"></a><a name="INDEX-3974"></a>
While in taint mode, Perl takes special precautions called <em class="emphasis">taint
checks</em> to prevent traps both obvious and subtle.  Some of these checks
are reasonably simple, such as verifying that dangerous environment
variables aren't set and that directories in your path aren't writable
by others; careful programmers have always used checks like these.
Other checks, however, are best supported by the language itself, and
it is these checks especially that contribute to making a privileged
Perl program more secure than the corresponding C program, or
a Perl CGI script more secure than one written in any language without
taint checks.  (Which, as far as we know, is any language other than
Perl.)</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-3975"></a><a name="INDEX-3976"></a><a name="INDEX-3977"></a><a name="INDEX-3978"></a>
The principle is simple: you may not use data derived from outside
your program to affect something else outside your program--at
least, not by accident.  Anything that comes from outside your
program is marked as tainted, including all command-line arguments,
environment variables, and file input.  Tainted data may not be
used directly or indirectly in any operation that invokes a subshell,
nor in any operation that modifies files, directories, or processes.
Any variable set within an expression that has previously referenced
a tainted value becomes tainted itself, even if it is logically
impossible for the tainted value to influence the variable.  Because
taintedness is associated with each scalar, some individual values
in an array or hash might be tainted and others might not.  (Only the
values in a hash can be tainted, though, not the keys.)</p>

<p>The following code illustrates how tainting would work if you executed
all these statements in order.  Statements marked "Insecure"
will trigger an exception, whereas those that are "OK" will not.
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">$arg = shift(@ARGV);          # $arg is now tainted (due to @ARGV).
$hid = "$arg, 'bar'";         # $hid also tainted (due to $arg).
$line = &lt;&gt;;                   # Tainted (reading from external file).
$path = $ENV{PATH};           # Tainted due to %ENV, but see below.
$mine = 'abc';                # Not tainted.

system "echo $mine";          # Insecure until PATH set.
system "echo $arg";           # Insecure: uses sh with tainted $arg.
system "echo", $arg;          # OK once PATH set (doesn't use sh).
system "echo $hid";           # Insecure two ways: taint, PATH.

$oldpath = $ENV{PATH};        # $oldpath is tainted (due to $ENV).
$ENV{PATH} = '/bin:/usr/bin'; # (Makes it OK to execute other programs.)
$newpath = $ENV{PATH};        # $newpath is NOT tainted.

delete @ENV{qw{IFS
               CDPATH
               ENV
               BASH_ENV}};    # Makes %ENV safer.

system "echo $mine";          # OK, is secure once path is reset.
system "echo $hid";           # Insecure via tainted $hid.

open(OOF, "&lt; $arg");          # OK (read-only opens not checked).
open(OOF, "&gt; $arg");          # Insecure (trying to write to tainted arg).

open(OOF, "echo $arg|")       # Insecure due to tainted $arg, but...
    or die "can't pipe from echo: $!";

open(OOF,"-|")                # Considered OK: see below for taint
    or exec "echo", $arg      #   exemption on exec'ing a list.
    or die "can't exec echo: $!";

open(OOF,"-|", "echo", $arg   # Same as previous, likewise OKish.
    or die "can't pipe from echo: $!";

$shout = `echo $arg`;         # Insecure via tainted $arg.
$shout = `echo abc`;          # $shout is tainted due to backticks.
$shout2 = `echo $shout`;      # Insecure via tainted $shout.

unlink $mine, $arg;           # Insecure via tainted $arg.
umask $arg;                   # Insecure via tainted $arg.

exec "echo $arg";             # Insecure via tainted $arg passed to shell.
exec "echo", $arg;            # Considered OK! (But see below.)
exec "sh", '-c', $arg;        # Considered OK, but isn't really!</pre>

<p>If you try to do something insecure, you get an exception (which
unless trapped, becomes a fatal error) such as "<tt class="literal">Insecure
dependency</tt>" or "<tt class="literal">Insecure $ENV{PATH}</tt>".
See the section <a href="ch23_01.htm#ch23-sect-cuye">Section 23.1.2, "Cleaning Up Your Environment"</a> later.</p>

<p>If you pass a <em class="replaceable">LIST</em> to a
<tt class="literal">system</tt>, <tt class="literal">exec</tt>, or pipe
<tt class="literal">open</tt>, the arguments are not inspected for
taintedness, because with a <em class="replaceable">LIST</em> of
arguments, Perl doesn't need to invoke the potentially dangerous shell
to run the command.  You can still easily write an insecure
<tt class="literal">system</tt>, <tt class="literal">exec</tt>, or pipe
<tt class="literal">open</tt> using the <em class="replaceable">LIST</em>
form, as demonstrated in the final example above.  These forms are
exempt from checking because you are presumed to know what you're
doing when you use them.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-3982"></a>
Sometimes, though, you can't tell how many arguments you're passing.
If you supply these functions with an array<a href="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a> that contains just
one element, then it's just as though you passed one string in the
first place, so the shell might be used.  The solution is to pass an
explicit path in the indirect-object slot:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">system @args;                 # Won't call the shell unless @args == 1.
system { $args[0] } @args;    # Bypasses shell even with one-argument list.</pre>

<h3 class="sect2">23.1.1. Detecting and Laundering Tainted Data</h3>

<a name="INDEX-3983"></a><a name="INDEX-3984"></a><a name="INDEX-3985"></a><a name="INDEX-3986"></a>
<p>To test whether a scalar variable contains tainted data, you can use
the following <tt class="literal">is_tainted</tt> function.  It makes use of
the fact that <tt class="literal">eval</tt><em class="replaceable">STRING</em> raises an exception if you try to
compile tainted data.  It doesn't matter that the
<tt class="literal">$nada</tt> variable used in the expression to compile
will always be empty; it will still be tainted if
<tt class="literal">$arg</tt> is tainted.  The outer <tt class="literal">eval</tt><em class="replaceable">BLOCK</em> isn't doing any compilation.  It's
just there to catch the exception raised if the inner
<tt class="literal">eval</tt> is given tainted data.  Since the
<tt class="literal">$@</tt> variable is guaranteed to be nonempty after each
<tt class="literal">eval</tt> if an exception was raised and empty
otherwise, we return the result of testing whether its length was
zero:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">sub is_tainted {
    my $arg = shift;
    my $nada = substr($arg, 0, 0);  # zero-length
    local $@;  # preserve caller's version
    eval { eval "# $nada" };
    return length($@) != 0;
}</pre>
</blockquote>

But testing for taintedness only gets you so far.  Usually you know
perfectly well which variables contain tainted data--you just have to
clear the data's taintedness.  The only official way to bypass the
tainting mechanism is by referencing submatches returned by an earlier
regular expression match.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a> When you write a pattern that contains
capturing parentheses, you can access the captured substrings through
match variables like <tt class="literal">$1</tt>, <tt class="literal">$2</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">$+</tt>, or by evaluating the pattern in list
context. Either way, the presumption is that you knew what you were
doing when you wrote the pattern and wrote it to weed out anything
dangerous.  So you need to give it some real thought--never blindly
untaint, or else you defeat the entire mechanism.</p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-3"></a>
<p>[3]An unofficial way is by
storing the tainted string as the key to a hash and fetching back that
key.  Because keys aren't really full SVs (internal name scalar
values), they don't carry the taint property.  This behavior may be
changed someday, so don't rely on it.  Be careful when handling keys,
lest you unintentionally untaint your data and do something unsafe
with them.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It's better to verify that the variable contains only good characters
than to check whether it contains any bad characters.  That's because
it's far too easy to miss bad characters that you never thought of.
For example, here's a test to make sure <tt class="literal">$string</tt>
contains nothing but "word" characters (alphabetics, numerics, and
underscores), hyphens, at signs, and dots:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">if ($string =~ /^([-\@\w.]+)$/) {
    $string = $1;                     # $string now untainted.
}
else {
    die "Bad data in $string";        # Log this somewhere.
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name="INDEX-3987"></a>
</p>

<p>This renders <tt class="literal">$string</tt> fairly secure to use later in
an external command, since <tt class="literal">/\w+/</tt> doesn't normally
match shell metacharacters, nor are those other characters going to
mean anything special to the shell.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</a> Had we used <tt class="literal">/(.+)/s</tt>
instead, it would have been unsafe because that pattern lets
everything through.  But Perl doesn't check for that.  When
untainting, be exceedingly careful with your patterns.  Laundering
data by using regular expressions is the <em class="emphasis">only</em>
approved internal mechanism for untainting dirty data.  And sometimes
it's the wrong approach entirely.  If you're in taint mode because
you're running set-id and not because you intentionally turned on
<span class="option">-T</span>, you can reduce your risk by forking a child of
lesser privilege; see the section <a href="ch23_01.htm#ch23-sect-cuye">Section 23.1.2, "Cleaning Up Your Environment"</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-4"></a>
<p>[4] Unless you were
using an intentionally broken locale.  Perl assumes that your system's
locale definitions are potentially compromised.  Hence, when running
under the <tt class="literal">use locale</tt> pragma, patterns with a
symbolic character class in them, such as <tt class="literal">\w</tt> or
<tt class="literal">[[:alpha:]]</tt>, produce tainted
results.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">use re 'taint'</tt> pragma disables the implicit
untainting of any pattern matches through the end of the current
lexical scope.  You might use this pragma if you just want to extract
a few substrings from some potentially tainted data, but since you
aren't being mindful of security, you'd prefer to leave the substrings
tainted to guard against unfortunate accidents later.</p>

<p>Imagine you're matching something like this, where
<tt class="literal">$fullpath</tt> is tainted:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">($dir, $file) = $fullpath =~ m!(.*/)(.*)!s;</pre>
</blockquote>

By default, <tt class="literal">$dir</tt> and <tt class="literal">$file</tt> would
now be untainted.  But you probably didn't want to do that so
cavalierly, because you never really thought about the security
issues.  For example, you might not be terribly happy if
<tt class="literal">$file</tt> contained the string "<tt class="literal">; rm -rf *
;</tt>", just to name one rather egregious example.  The
following code leaves the two result variables tainted if
<tt class="literal">$fullpath</tt> was tainted:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">{
    use re 'taint';
    ($dir, $file) = $fullpath =~ m!(.*/)(.*)!s;
}</pre>
</blockquote>

A good strategy is to leave submatches tainted by default over the
whole source file and only selectively permit untainting in nested
scopes as needed:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">use re 'taint';
# remainder of file now leaves $1 etc tainted
{
    no re 'taint';
    # this block now untaints re matches
    if ($num =~ /^(\d+)$/) {
        $num = $1;
    }
}</pre>
</blockquote>

Input from a filehandle or a directory handle is automatically
tainted, except when it comes from the special filehandle, <tt class="literal">DATA</tt>.
If you want to, you can mark other handles as trusted sources
via the <tt class="literal">IO::Handle</tt> module's <tt class="literal">untaint</tt> function:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">use IO::Handle;

IO::Handle::untaint(*SOME_FH);          # Either procedurally
SOME_FH-&gt;untaint();                     # or using the OO style.</pre>
</blockquote>

Turning off tainting on an entire filehandle is a risky move.  How
do you <em class="emphasis">really</em> know it's safe?  If you're going to do this, you
should at least verify that nobody but the owner can write to the
file.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a> If you're on a Unix filesystem (and
one that prudently restricts <em class="emphasis">chown</em>(2) to the superuser), the
following code works:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">use File::stat;
use Symbol 'qualify_to_ref';
sub handle_looks_safe(*) {
    my $fh = qualify_to_ref(shift, caller);
    my $info = stat($fh);
    return unless $info;

    # owner neither superuser nor "me", whose
    # real uid is in the $&lt; variable
    if ($info-&gt;uid != 0 &amp;&amp; $info-&gt;uid != $&lt;) {
        return 0;
    }

    # check whether group or other can write file.
    # use 066 to detect for readability also
    if ($info-&gt;mode &amp; 022) {
        return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}

use IO::Handle;
SOME_FH-&gt;untaint() if handle_looks_safe(*SOME_FH);</pre>
</blockquote>

We called <tt class="literal">stat</tt> on the filehandle, not the filename, to avoid a
dangerous race condition.  See the section <a href="ch23_02.htm#ch23-sect-hrc">Section 23.2.2, "Handling Race Conditions"</a>
later in this chapter.</p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-5"></a>
<p>[5] Although you can untaint a directory handle,
too, this function only works on a filehandle.  That's because given
a directory handle, there's no portable way to extract its file
descriptor to <tt class="literal">stat</tt>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Note that this routine is only a good start.  A slightly more
paranoid version would check all parent directories as well, even though you
can't reliably <tt class="literal">stat</tt> a directory handle.  But if any parent directory
is world-writable, you know you're in trouble whether or not there are race conditions.</p>

<p>Perl has its own notion of which operations are dangerous, but it's
still possible to get into trouble with other operations that don't
care whether they use tainted values.  It's not always enough to
be careful of input.  Perl output functions don't test whether their
arguments are tainted, but in some environments, this matters.  If
you aren't careful of what you output, you might just end up spitting
out strings that have unexpected meanings to whoever is processing
the output.  If you're running on a terminal, special escape and
control codes could cause the viewer's terminal to act strangely.
If you're in a web environment and you blindly spit back out data that
was given to you, you could unknowingly produce HTML tags that
would drastically alter the page's appearance.  Worse still, some
markup tags can even execute code back on the browser.</p>

<p>Imagine the common case of a guest book where visitors enter their own
messages to be displayed when others come calling.  A malicious guest
could supply unsightly HTML tags or put in
<tt class="literal">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;...&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</tt> sequences
that execute code (like JavaScript) back in the browsers of subsequent
guests.</p>

<p>Just as you should carefully check for only good characters when
inspecting tainted data that accesses resources on your own system,
you should apply the same care in a web environment when presenting
data supplied by a user.  For example, to strip the data of any
character not in the specified list of good characters, try something
like this:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">$new_guestbook_entry =~ tr[_a-zA-Z0-9 ,./!?()@+*-][]dc;</pre>
</blockquote>

You certainly wouldn't use that to clean up a filename, since you
probably don't want filenames with spaces or slashes, just for
starters.  But it's enough to keep your guest book free of
sneaky HTML tags and entities.  Each data-laundering case is a
little bit different, so always spend time deciding what is and
what is not permitted.  The tainting mechanism is intended to catch
stupid mistakes, not to remove the need for thought.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">23.1.2. Cleaning Up Your Environment</h3>

<a name="INDEX-3991"></a><a name="INDEX-3992"></a><a name="INDEX-3993"></a><a name="INDEX-3994"></a>
<p>When you execute another program from within your Perl script, no
matter how, Perl checks to make sure your <tt class="literal">PATH</tt>
environment variable is secure.  Since it came from your environment,
your <tt class="literal">PATH</tt> starts out tainted, so if you try to run
another program, Perl raises an "<tt class="literal">Insecure
$ENV{PATH}</tt>" exception.  When you set it to a known,
untainted value, Perl makes sure that each directory in that path is
nonwritable by anyone other than the directory's owner and group;
otherwise, it raises an "<tt class="literal">Insecure directory</tt>"
exception.</p>

<p>You may be surprised to find that Perl cares about your
<tt class="literal">PATH</tt> even when you specify the full pathname of the
command you want to execute.  It's true that with an absolute
filename, the <tt class="literal">PATH</tt> isn't used to find the
executable to run.  But there's no reason to trust the program you're
running not to turn right around and execute some
<em class="emphasis">other</em> program and get into trouble because of the
insecure <tt class="literal">PATH</tt>.  So Perl forces you to set a secure
<tt class="literal">PATH</tt> before you call any program, no matter how you
say to call it.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-3995"></a>
The <tt class="literal">PATH</tt> isn't the only environment variable that
can bring grief.  Because some shells use the variables
<tt class="literal">IFS</tt>, <tt class="literal">CDPATH</tt>,
<tt class="literal">ENV</tt>, and <tt class="literal">BASH_ENV</tt>, Perl makes
sure that those are all either empty or untainted before it will run
another command.  Either set these variables to something known to be
safe, or else delete them from the environment altogether:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">delete @ENV{qw(IFS CDPATH ENV BASH_ENV)};   # Make %ENV safer</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name="INDEX-3996"></a><a name="INDEX-3997"></a><a name="INDEX-3998"></a>
Features convenient in a normal environment can become security
concerns in a hostile one.  Even if you remember to disallow filenames
containing newlines, it's important to understand that
<tt class="literal">open</tt> accesses more than just named files.  Given
appropriate ornamentation on the filename argument, one- or
two-argument calls to <tt class="literal">open</tt> can also run arbitrary
external commands via pipes, fork extra copies of the current process,
duplicate file descriptors, and interpret the special filename
"<tt class="literal">-</tt>" as an alias for standard input or output.  It
can also ignore leading and trailing whitespace that might disguise
such fancy arguments from your check patterns.  While it's true that
Perl's taint checking will catch tainted arguments used for pipe opens
(unless you use a separated argument list) and any file opens that
aren't read-only, the exception this raises is still likely to make
your program misbehave.</p>

<p>If you intend to use any externally derived data as part of a filename
to open, at least include an explicit mode separated by a space.  It's
probably safest, though, to use either the low-level
<tt class="literal">sysopen</tt> or the three-argument form of
<tt class="literal">open</tt>:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting"># Magic open--could be anything
open(FH, $file)             or die "can't magic open $file: $!";


# Guaranteed to be a read-only file open and not a pipe
# or fork, but still groks file descriptors and "-",
# and ignores whitespace at either end of name.
open(FH, "&lt; $file")         or die "can't open $file: $!";

# WYSIWYG open: disables all convenience features.
open(FH, "&lt;", $file)        or die "can't open $file: $!";

# Same properties as WYSIWYG 3-arg version.
require Fcntl;
sysopen(FH, $file, O_RDONLY)        or die "can't sysopen $file: $!";</pre>
</blockquote>

Even these steps aren't quite good enough.  Perl doesn't prevent
you from opening tainted filenames for reading, so you need to be
careful of what you show people.  A program that opens an arbitrary,
user-supplied filename for reading and then reveals that file's
contents is still a security problem.  What if it's a private letter?
What if it's your system password file?  What if it's salary information
or your stock portfolio?</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-3999"></a><a name="INDEX-4000"></a>
Look closely at filenames provided by a potentially hostile
user<a href="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a> before opening them.  For example, you might want
to verify that there are no sneaky directory components in the path.
Names like "<tt class="literal">../../../../../../../etc/passwd</tt>" are notorious tricks of
this sort.  You can protect yourself by making sure there are no
slashes in the pathname (assuming that's your system's directory
separator).  Another common trick is to put newlines or semicolons into
filenames that will later be interpreted by some poor, witless
command-line interpreter that can be fooled into starting a new command
in the middle of the filename.  This is why taint mode discourages uninspected 
external commands.</p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-6"></a>
<p>[6]And on the Net, the only users you can trust not to be
potentially hostile are the ones who are being <em class="emphasis">actively</em> hostile
instead.</p>

<a name="ch23-sect-access"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">23.1.3. Accessing Commands and Files Under
Reduced Privileges</h3>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-4001"></a><a name="INDEX-4002"></a><a name="INDEX-4003"></a><a name="INDEX-4004"></a>
The following discussion pertains to some nifty security facilities of Unix-like
systems.  Users of other systems may safely (or rather, unsafely)
skip this section.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-4005"></a><a name="INDEX-4006"></a>
If you're running set-id, try to arrange that, whenever possible, you
do dangerous operations with the privileges of the user, not the
privileges of the program.  That is, whenever you're going to call
<tt class="literal">open</tt>, <tt class="literal">sysopen</tt>,
<tt class="literal">system</tt>, backticks, and any other file or process
operations, you can protect yourself by setting your effective UID or
GID back to the real UID or GID.  In Perl, you can do this for setuid
scripts by saying <tt class="literal">$&gt; = $&lt;</tt> (or <tt class="literal">$EUID
= $UID</tt> if you <tt class="literal">use English</tt>) and for setgid
scripts by saying <tt class="literal">$( = $)</tt> (<tt class="literal">$EGID =
$GID</tt>).  If both IDs are set, you should reset both.
However, sometimes

this isn't feasible, because you might still need
those increased privileges later in your program.</p>

<p>For those cases, Perl provides a reasonably safe way to open a file or
pipe from within a set-id program.  First, fork a child using the
special <tt class="literal">open</tt> syntax that connects the parent and
child by a pipe.  In the child, reset the user and group IDs back to
their original or known safe values.  You also get to modify any of
the child's per-process attributes without affecting the parent,
letting you change the working directory, set the file creation mask,
or fiddle with environment variables.  No longer executing under extra
privileges, the child process at last calls <tt class="literal">open</tt>
and passes whatever data it manages to access on behalf of the mundane
but demented user back up to its powerful but justly paranoid parent.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-4007"></a>
Even though <tt class="literal">system</tt> and <tt class="literal">exec</tt> don't use the shell when you
supply them with more than one argument, the backtick operator
admits no such alternative calling convention. Using the forking
technique, we easily emulate backticks without fear of shell escapes,
and with reduced (and therefore safer) privileges:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">use English;   # to use $UID, etc
die "Can't fork open: $!"   unless defined($pid = open(FROMKID, "-|"));
if ($pid) {           # parent
    while (&lt;FROMKID&gt;) {
        # do something
    }
    close FROMKID;
}
else {
    $EUID = $UID;  # setuid(getuid())
    $EGID = $GID;  # setgid(getgid()), and initgroups(2) on getgroups(2)
    chdir("/")      or die "can't chdir to /: $!";
    umask(077);
    $ENV{PATH} = "/bin:/usr/bin";
    exec 'myprog', 'arg1', 'arg2';
    die "can't exec myprog: $!";
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name="INDEX-4008"></a>
This is by far the best way to call other programs from a set-id
script.  You make sure never to use the shell to execute anything,
and you drop your privileges before you yourself <tt class="literal">exec</tt> the program.
(But because the list forms of <tt class="literal">system</tt>, <tt class="literal">exec</tt>, and pipe <tt class="literal">open</tt>
are specifically exempted from taint checks on their arguments, you
must still be careful of what you pass in.)</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-4009"></a>
If you don't need to drop privileges, and just want to implement
backticks or a pipe <tt class="literal">open</tt> without risking the shell intercepting
your arguments, you could use this:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">open(FROMKID, "-|") or exec("myprog", "arg1", "arg2")
    or die "can't run myprog: $!";</pre>
</blockquote>
and then just read from <tt class="literal">FROMKID</tt> in the parent.  As
of the 5.6.1 release of Perl, you can write that as:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">open(FROMKID, "-|", "myprog", "arg1", "arg2");</pre>
</blockquote>

The forking technique is useful for more than just running commands
from a set-id program.  It's also good for opening files under the ID
of whoever ran the program.  Suppose you had a setuid program that
needed to open a file for writing.  You don't want to run the
<tt class="literal">open</tt> under your extra privileges, but you can't
permanently drop them, either.  So arrange for a forked copy that's
dropped its privileges to do the <tt class="literal">open</tt> for you.
When you want to write to the file, write to the child, and it will
then write to the file for you.
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">use English;

defined ($pid = open(SAFE_WRITER, "|-"))
    or die "Can't fork: $!";

if ($pid) {
    # you're the parent. write data to SAFE_WRITER child
    print SAFE_WRITER "@output_data\n";
    close SAFE_WRITER
        or die $! ? "Syserr closing SAFE_WRITER writer: $!"
                  : "Wait status $? from SAFE_WRITER writer";
}
else {
    # you're the child, so drop extra privileges
    ($EUID, $EGID) = ($UID, $GID);

    # open the file under original user's rights
    open(FH, "&gt; /some/file/path")
        or die "can't open /some/file/path for writing: $!";

    # copy from parent (now stdin) into the file
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        print FH $_;
    }
    close(FH)   or die "close failed: $!";
    exit;       # Don't forget to make the SAFE_WRITER disappear.
}</pre>
</blockquote>

Upon failing to open the file, the child prints an error message and
exits.  When the parent writes to the now-defunct child's filehandle,
it triggers a broken pipe signal (<tt class="literal">SIGPIPE</tt>), which
is fatal unless trapped or ignored.  See the section <a href="ch16_01.htm#ch16-sect-signals">Section 23.1, "Signals"</a> in
<a href="ch16_01.htm">Chapter 16, "Interprocess Communication"</a>.
