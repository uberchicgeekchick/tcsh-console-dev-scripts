<p>perlfaq2 - Obtaining and Learning about Perl ($Revision: 1.39 $, $Date: 2006/01/08 14:27:07 $)</p>
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This section of the FAQ answers questions about where to find
source and documentation for Perl, support, and
related matters.</p>
<a name="What-machines-support-perl%3f--Where-do-I-get-it%3f"></a><h2>What machines support perl?  Where do I get it?</h2>
<p>The standard release of perl (the one maintained by the perl
development team) is distributed only in source code form.  You
can find this at <a href="http://www.cpan.org/src/latest.tar.gz">http://www.cpan.org/src/latest.tar.gz</a> , which
is in a standard Internet format (a gzipped archive in POSIX tar format).</p>
<p>Perl builds and runs on a bewildering number of platforms.  Virtually
all known and current Unix derivatives are supported (perl's native
platform), as are other systems like VMS, DOS, OS/2, Windows,
QNX, BeOS, OS X, MPE/iX and the Amiga.</p>
<p>Binary distributions for some proprietary platforms, including
Apple systems, can be found <a href="http://www.cpan.org/ports/">http://www.cpan.org/ports/</a> directory.
Because these are not part of the standard distribution, they may
and in fact do differ from the base perl port in a variety of ways.
You'll have to check their respective release notes to see just
what the differences are.  These differences can be either positive
(e.g. extensions for the features of the particular platform that
are not supported in the source release of perl) or negative (e.g.
might be based upon a less current source release of perl).</p>
<a name="How-can-I-get-a-binary-version-of-perl%3f"></a><h2>How can I get a binary version of perl?</h2>
<p>If you don't have a C compiler because your vendor for whatever
reasons did not include one with your system, the best thing to do is
grab a binary version of gcc from the net and use that to compile perl
with.  CPAN only has binaries for systems that are terribly hard to
get free compilers for, not for Unix systems.</p>
<p>Some URLs that might help you are:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    http://www.cpan.org/ports/
    http://www.perl.com/pub/language/info/software.html</pre><p>Someone looking for a perl for Win16 might look to Laszlo Molnar's djgpp
port in <a href="http://www.cpan.org/ports/#msdos">http://www.cpan.org/ports/#msdos</a> , which comes with clear
installation instructions.  A simple installation guide for MS-DOS using
Ilya Zakharevich's OS/2 port is available at
<a href="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perl5dos.html">http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perl5dos.html</a>
and similarly for Windows 3.1 at <a href="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perlwin3.html">http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perlwin3.html</a> .</p>
<a name="I-don't-have-a-C-compiler.-How-can-I-build-my-own-Perl-interpreter%3f"></a><h2>I don't have a C compiler. How can I build my own Perl interpreter?</h2>
<p>Since you don't have a C compiler, you're doomed and your vendor
should be sacrificed to the Sun gods.  But that doesn't help you.</p>
<p>What you need to do is get a binary version of gcc for your system
first.  Consult the Usenet FAQs for your operating system for
information on where to get such a binary version.</p>
<a name="I-copied-the-perl-binary-from-one-machine-to-another%2c-but-scripts-don't-work."></a><h2>I copied the perl binary from one machine to another, but scripts don't work.</h2>
<p>That's probably because you forgot libraries, or library paths differ.
You really should build the whole distribution on the machine it will
eventually live on, and then type <code class="inline">make install</code>
.  Most other
approaches are doomed to failure.</p>
<p>One simple way to check that things are in the right place is to print out
the hard-coded @INC that perl looks through for libraries:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <span class="i">% perl</span> -le <span class="q">&#39;print for @INC&#39;</span></pre>
<p>If this command lists any paths that don't exist on your system, then you
may need to move the appropriate libraries to these locations, or create
symbolic links, aliases, or shortcuts appropriately.  @INC is also printed as
part of the output of</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <span class="i">% perl</span> -V</pre>
<p>You might also want to check out
<a href="perlfaq8.html#How-do-I-keep-my-own-module%2flibrary-directory%3f">"How do I keep my own module/library directory?" in perlfaq8</a>.</p>
<a name="I-grabbed-the-sources-and-tried-to-compile-but-gdbm%2fdynamic-loading%2fmalloc%2flinking%2f...-failed.--How-do-I-make-it-work%3f"></a><h2>I grabbed the sources and tried to compile but gdbm/dynamic loading/malloc/linking/... failed.  How do I make it work?</h2>
<p>Read the <i>INSTALL</i> file, which is part of the source distribution.
It describes in detail how to cope with most idiosyncrasies that the
Configure script can't work around for any given system or
architecture.</p>
<a name="What-modules-and-extensions-are-available-for-Perl%3f--What-is-CPAN%3f--What-does-CPAN%2fsrc%2f...-mean%3f"></a><h2>What modules and extensions are available for Perl?  What is CPAN?  What does CPAN/src/... mean?</h2>
<p>CPAN stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a ~1.2Gb archive
replicated on nearly 200 machines all over the world.  CPAN contains
source code, non-native ports, documentation, scripts, and many
third-party modules and extensions, designed for everything from
commercial database interfaces to keyboard/screen control to web
walking and CGI scripts.  The master web site for CPAN is
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a> and there is the CPAN Multiplexer at
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html">http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html</a> which will choose a mirror near you
via DNS.  See <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN">http://www.perl.com/CPAN</a> (without a slash at the
end) for how this process works. Also, <a href="http://mirror.cpan.org/">http://mirror.cpan.org/</a>
has a nice interface to the <a href="http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY">http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY</a>
mirror directory.</p>
<p>See the CPAN FAQ at <a href="http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html">http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html</a> for
answers to the most frequently asked questions about CPAN
including how to become a mirror.</p>
<p>CPAN/path/... is a naming convention for files available on CPAN
sites.  CPAN indicates the base directory of a CPAN mirror, and the
rest of the path is the path from that directory to the file.  For
instance, if you're using <a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN">ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN</a>
as your CPAN site, the file CPAN/misc/japh is downloadable as
<a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/misc/japh">ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/misc/japh</a> .</p>
<p>Considering that there are close to two thousand existing modules in
the archive, one probably exists to do nearly anything you can think of.
Current categories under CPAN/modules/by-category/ include Perl core
modules; development support; operating system interfaces; networking,
devices, and interprocess communication; data type utilities; database
interfaces; user interfaces; interfaces to other languages; filenames,
file systems, and file locking; internationalization and locale; world
wide web support; server and daemon utilities; archiving and
compression; image manipulation; mail and news; control flow
utilities; filehandle and I/O; Microsoft Windows modules; and
miscellaneous modules.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html">http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html</a> or
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a> for a more complete list of modules by category.</p>
<p>CPAN is not affiliated with O'Reilly Media.</p>
<a name="Is-there-an-ISO-or-ANSI-certified-version-of-Perl%3f"></a><h2>Is there an ISO or ANSI certified version of Perl?</h2>
<p>Certainly not.  Larry expects that he'll be certified before Perl is.</p>
<a name="Where-can-I-get-information-on-Perl%3f"></a><h2>Where can I get information on Perl?</h2>
<p>The complete Perl documentation is available with the Perl distribution.
If you have Perl installed locally, you probably have the documentation
installed as well: type <code class="inline">man perl</code>
 if you're on a system resembling Unix.
This will lead you to other important man pages, including how to set your
$MANPATH.  If you're not on a Unix system, access to the documentation
will be different; for example, documentation might only be in HTML format.  All
proper perl installations have fully-accessible documentation.</p>
<p>You might also try <code class="inline">perldoc perl</code>
 in case your system doesn't
have a proper man command, or it's been misinstalled.  If that doesn't
work, try looking in /usr/local/lib/perl5/pod for documentation.</p>
<p>If all else fails, consult <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/">http://perldoc.perl.org/</a> which has the
complete documentation in HTML and PDF format.</p>
<p>Many good books have been written about Perl--see the section below
for more details.</p>
<p>Tutorial documents are included in current or upcoming Perl releases
include <a href="perltoot.html">perltoot</a> for objects or <a href="perlboot.html">perlboot</a> for a beginner's
approach to objects, <a href="perlopentut.html">perlopentut</a> for file opening semantics,
<a href="perlreftut.html">perlreftut</a> for managing references, <a href="perlretut.html">perlretut</a> for regular
expressions, <a href="perlthrtut.html">perlthrtut</a> for threads, <a href="perldebtut.html">perldebtut</a> for debugging,
and <a href="perlxstut.html">perlxstut</a> for linking C and Perl together.  There may be more
by the time you read this.  These URLs might also be useful:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    http://perldoc.perl.org/
    http://bookmarks.cpan.org/search.cgi?cat=Training%2FTutorials</pre><a name="What-are-the-Perl-newsgroups-on-Usenet%3f--Where-do-I-post-questions%3f"></a><h2>What are the Perl newsgroups on Usenet?  Where do I post questions?</h2>
<p>Several groups devoted to the Perl language are on Usenet:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    comp.lang.perl.announce 		Moderated announcement group
    comp.lang.perl.misc     		High traffic general Perl discussion
    comp.lang.perl.moderated        Moderated discussion group
    comp.lang.perl.modules  		Use and development of Perl modules
    comp.lang.perl.tk           	Using Tk (and X) from Perl</pre><pre class="verbatim">    comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi 	Writing <a class="l_w" href="CGI.html">CGI</a> scripts for the Web.</pre>
<p>Some years ago, comp.lang.perl was divided into those groups, and
comp.lang.perl itself officially removed.  While that group may still
be found on some news servers, it is unwise to use it, because
postings there will not appear on news servers which honour the
official list of group names.  Use comp.lang.perl.misc for topics
which do not have a more-appropriate specific group.</p>
<p>There is also a Usenet gateway to Perl mailing lists sponsored by
perl.org at nntp://nntp.perl.org , a web interface to the same lists
at <a href="http://nntp.perl.org/group/">http://nntp.perl.org/group/</a> and these lists are also available
under the <code class="inline">perl.<span class="i">*</span></code>
 hierarchy at <a href="http://groups.google.com">http://groups.google.com</a> . Other
groups are listed at <a href="http://lists.perl.org/">http://lists.perl.org/</a> ( also known as
<a href="http://lists.cpan.org/">http://lists.cpan.org/</a> ).</p>
<p>A nice place to ask questions is the PerlMonks site,
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/">http://www.perlmonks.org/</a> , or the Perl Beginners mailing list
<a href="http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=beginners">http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=beginners</a> .</p>
<p>Note that none of the above are supposed to write your code for you:
asking questions about particular problems or general advice is fine,
but asking someone to write your code for free is not very cool.</p>
<a name="Where-should-I-post-source-code%3f"></a><h2>Where should I post source code?</h2>
<p>You should post source code to whichever group is most appropriate, but
feel free to cross-post to comp.lang.perl.misc.  If you want to cross-post
to alt.sources, please make sure it follows their posting standards,
including setting the Followup-To header line to NOT include alt.sources;
see their FAQ ( <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-sources-intro/">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-sources-intro/</a> ) for details.</p>
<p>If you're just looking for software, first use Google
( <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> ), Google's usenet search interface
( <a href="http://groups.google.com">http://groups.google.com</a> ),  and CPAN Search ( <a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a> ).
This is faster and more productive than just posting a request.</p>
<a name="Perl-Books"></a><h2>Perl Books</h2>
<p>A number of books on Perl and/or CGI programming are available.  A few
of these are good, some are OK, but many aren't worth your money.
There is a list of these books, some with extensive reviews, at
<a href="http://books.perl.org/">http://books.perl.org/</a> . If you don't see your book listed here, you
can write to perlfaq-workers@perl.org .</p>

<a name="Which-magazines-have-Perl-content%3f"></a><h2>Which magazines have Perl content?</h2>
<p>The first (and for a long time, only) periodical devoted to All Things Perl,
<i>The Perl Journal</i> contains tutorials, demonstrations, case studies,
announcements, contests, and much more.  <i>TPJ</i> has columns on web
development, databases, Win32 Perl, graphical programming, regular
expressions, and networking, and sponsors the Obfuscated Perl Contest
and the Perl Poetry Contests.  Beginning in November 2002, TPJ moved to a
reader-supported monthly e-zine format in which subscribers can download
issues as PDF documents. For more details on TPJ, see <a href="http://www.tpj.com/">http://www.tpj.com/</a></p>
<p>Beyond this, magazines that frequently carry quality articles on
Perl are <i>The Perl Review</i> ( <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com">http://www.theperlreview.com</a> ),
<i>Unix Review</i> ( <a href="http://www.unixreview.com/">http://www.unixreview.com/</a> ),
<i>Linux Magazine</i> ( <a href="http://www.linuxmagazine.com/">http://www.linuxmagazine.com/</a> ),
and Usenix's newsletter/magazine to its members, <i>login:</i>
( <a href="http://www.usenix.org/">http://www.usenix.org/</a> )</p>
<p>The Perl columns of Randal L. Schwartz are available on the web at
<a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/WebTechniques/">http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/WebTechniques/</a> ,
<a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/">http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/</a> , and
<a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/">http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/</a> .</p>
<a name="What-mailing-lists-are-there-for-Perl%3f"></a><h2>What mailing lists are there for Perl?</h2>
<p>Most of the major modules (Tk, CGI, libwww-perl) have their own
mailing lists.  Consult the documentation that came with the module for
subscription information.</p>
<p>A comprehensive list of Perl related mailing lists can be found at:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">	http://lists.perl.org/</pre><a name="Where-are-the-archives-for-comp.lang.perl.misc%3f"></a><h2>Where are the archives for comp.lang.perl.misc?</h2>
<p>The Google search engine now carries archived and searchable newsgroup
content.</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?group=comp.lang.perl.misc">http://groups.google.com/groups?group=comp.lang.perl.misc</a></p>
<p>If you have a question, you can be sure someone has already asked the
same question at some point on c.l.p.m. It requires some time and patience
to sift through all the content but often you will find the answer you
seek.</p>
<a name="Where-can-I-buy-a-commercial-version-of-perl%3f"></a><h2>Where can I buy a commercial version of perl?</h2>
<p>In a real sense, perl already <i>is</i> commercial software: it has a license
that you can grab and carefully read to your manager. It is distributed
in releases and comes in well-defined packages. There is a very large
user community and an extensive literature.  The comp.lang.perl.*
newsgroups and several of the mailing lists provide free answers to your
questions in near real-time.  Perl has traditionally been supported by
Larry, scores of software designers and developers, and myriad
programmers, all working for free to create a useful thing to make life
better for everyone.</p>
<p>However, these answers may not suffice for managers who require a
purchase order from a company whom they can sue should anything go awry.
Or maybe they need very serious hand-holding and contractual obligations.
Shrink-wrapped CDs with perl on them are available from several sources if
that will help.  For example, many Perl books include a distribution of perl,
as do the O'Reilly Perl Resource Kits (in both the Unix flavor
and in the proprietary Microsoft flavor); the free Unix distributions
also all come with perl.</p>
<a name="Where-do-I-send-bug-reports%3f"></a><h2>Where do I send bug reports?</h2>
<p>If you are reporting a bug in the perl interpreter or the modules
shipped with Perl, use the <i>perlbug</i> program in the Perl distribution or
mail your report to perlbug@perl.org or at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .</p>
<p>For Perl modules, you can submit bug reports to the Request Tracker set
up at <a href="http://rt.cpan.org">http://rt.cpan.org</a> .</p>
<p>If you are posting a bug with a non-standard port (see the answer to
"What platforms is perl available for?"), a binary distribution, or a
non-standard module (such as Tk, CGI, etc), then please see the
documentation that came with it to determine the correct place to post
bugs.</p>
<p>Read the perlbug(1) man page (perl5.004 or later) for more information.</p>
<a name="What-is-perl.com%3f-Perl-Mongers%3f-pm.org%3f-perl.org%3f-cpan.org%3f"></a><h2>What is perl.com? Perl Mongers? pm.org? perl.org? cpan.org?</h2>
<p>Perl.com at <a href="http://www.perl.com/">http://www.perl.com/</a> is part of the O'Reilly Network, a
subsidiary of O'Reilly Media.</p>
<p>The Perl Foundation is an advocacy organization for the Perl language
which maintains the web site <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> as a general
advocacy site for the Perl language. It uses the domain to provide
general support services to the Perl community, including the hosting
of mailing lists, web sites, and other services.  The web site
<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> is a general advocacy site for the Perl language,
and there are many other sub-domains for special topics, such as</p>
<pre class="verbatim">	http://learn.perl.org/
	http://use.perl.org/
	http://jobs.perl.org/
	http://lists.perl.org/</pre><p>Perl Mongers uses the pm.org domain for services related to Perl user
groups, including the hosting of mailing lists and web sites.  See the
Perl user group web site at <a href="http://www.pm.org/">http://www.pm.org/</a> for more information about
joining, starting, or requesting services for a Perl user group.</p>
