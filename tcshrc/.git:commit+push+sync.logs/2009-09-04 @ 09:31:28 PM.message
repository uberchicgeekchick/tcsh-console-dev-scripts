uber improved tcsh session setup

I've completely refactored my tcsh login session scripts.  Its now much faster & handles what tcsh passes "across sessions" & how it uses setenv.  I have also added some special features for using these scripts on Asus' EEE PC.

Oh yeah & I'm sure there's a bunch of other stuff too.

Wholy fuck my Generalized Dystonia's been really bad latel.  Today has just been to hard.  I hope my new Dr can help - I hope m new med helps... & still I hope (gotta stop).  Okay so I need something to help: I need help.  DYSTONIA SUCKS!
