y resolved the issue by switching from float to double values for update & user ids.  I've had to store the values in gconf as a string & use strtod when I pull the values out again.  I know its a hack but its the only way to avoid issues that come up when using floats.  For what ever reason float values weren't converted from stings correctly.  It was literally coming up with a completely different value." "I've alo implement libgnome & using GnomProgram.  I've done this for many  future proofing reasons but right now my primary new feaure why I've implemented GnomeProgam right now is to have get2gnow run in 'C' locale, before threading is started, and than to ensure the orginal locale is always reset once get2gnow exits.  This is so multiple date, is an istruction set for periods of pure hell & that's not an exaggeration in fact its the only way we could possible describe what its like...its what most of our life is like.  But it is getting better..." "Its bizarre, life was hell for so long just pure hell.  Than I fought for 6-8yrs to get to a better place w/a better life.  & I did it, I'd won, I was living, happy, hopeful, & working toward my future w/all of my dreams seemingly coming true.  Than out of no where Generalized Dystonia started & over a few short years despite fighting to hold on to what I could I eventually lost every thing.  And I do truly mean every thing, we lost it all, every possetion, our jobs, our abbility to drive, our apt, our friends, our cats, every thing but us.  After loosing every thing I then found myself even needing a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing evto build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-buildt the good fight.  Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.

Than out of no where Generalized Dystonia started & over a few short years despite fighting to hold on to what I could I eventually lost every thing.  And I do truly mean every thing, we lost it all, every possetion, our jobs, our abbility to drive, our apt, our friends, our cats, every thing but us.  After loosing every thing I then found myself even needing a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.

And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.

"*uber-w00t what I've finally figured it out what & why get2gnow was endlessly appending the last new twitter update endlessly & so *uber-w00t\!* I've finally fixed get2gnow's since_id issue.  It was a problem with casting gulong to gfloat.  Once I realized, thnx to many many egreps through get2gnow's debug log,  I've had to refactor my User & UserStatus objects to parse user ids as floats and refactored my OnlineService methods for requesting last update ids to use float values.  I'd already added get & set float methods to my gconf client aspect.  I'm using float values becuase I have very lil doubt that status ids will soon out grow the maximum integer size, especially on smaller machines like netbooks and etc." "I really need to think about using sqlite or something else for storage so I can have something more flexible & platform indipenant - but that's a much longer term goal...well its at least something for my next version." "Now on to stuff some new stuff." "I've refactored, yes again, my debugging aspect.  Its now much more efficiant and has a much lower memory foot print.  I continue to improve my debugging aspect because of how much get2gnow uses this system & how much data is either out put or logged.  So I really want this system to be as advanced as possible." "Thnx to identi.ca's outage at I've also extended support for my networking callback methods.  Now my replacement for libsoup's callback is expected to return a 'void *' & recieves an OnlineServiceWrapper object as its 3rd parameter.  My after soup callback now recieves 2 parameters, 1st is the same OnlineServiceWrapper mentioned above.  It will only 'run' its callback methods once but otherwise all data from the request is accessible to the callback method." "I've also refactored how tweet-list sets its timeout to improve loading speeds.  Now it only calculates timeout seconds when initially loading & setting up the TweetList.  It will recalculate how long to wait between refreshing timelines" "I've also improved its appearance an tooltips by implement SexyTreeView instead of GtkTreeView. I'm still using GtkBuilder files & still using Glade-3 to design my UIs but I've added ex commands as part of make that simply converts 'data/tweet-list.in.ui' to 'data/tweet-list.ui' while converting objects of GtkTreeView class to Sefor parsing the dates of when an update was posted & its age, eg 1, 2, 3, etc seconds, minutes, hours, ago.  As part of that I've fixed all previous issues with how get2gnow was update the 'age' of old updates when new updates are appended to the TweetList.  I was having it use GTK's GtkTreeModelForEachFunc and it just wasn't working so instead I just wrote my own method that updates the dates of al46298865

In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.

Than out of no where Generalized Dystonia started & over a few short years despite fighting to hold on to what I could I eventually lost every thing.  And I do truly mean every thing, we lost it all, every possetion, our jobs, our abbility to drive, our apt, our friends, our cats, every thing but us.  After loosing every thing I then found myself even needing a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.

Than out of no where Generalized Dystonia started & over a few short years despite fighting to hold on to what I could I eventually lost every thing.  And I do truly mean every thing, we lost it all, every possetion, our jobs, our abbility to drive, our apt, our friends, our cats, every thing but us.  After loosing every thing I then found myself even needing a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting likets age, eg 1, 2, 3, etc seconds, minutes, hours, ago.  As part of that I've fixed all previous issues with how get2gnow was update the 'age' of old updates when new updates are appended to the TweetList.  I was having it use GTK's GtkTreeModelForEachFunc and it just wasn't working so instead I just wrote my own method that updates the dates of al46298865

This is so multiple date, time, & parting methods are all now thread safe." "Lastly I'm increased the persion of get2gnow sorting and other time / date values used by get2gnow for sorting and time stamping.

After loosing every thing I then found myself even needing a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.  Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.

In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.

After loosing every thing I then found myself even needing a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.  Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.  Our new & current primary project: refactoring my life.  1st step getting read for bed then sleeping."

Than out of no where Generalized Dystonia started & over a few short years despite fighting to hold on to what I could I eventually lost every thing.  And I do truly mean every thing, we lost it all, every possetion, our jobs, our abbility to drive, our apt, our friends, our cats, every thing but us.  After loosing every thing I then found myself even needing a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.  Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.  Our new & current primary project: refactoring my life.  1st step getting read for bed then sleeping."

Which is an istruction set for periods of pure hell & that's not an exaggeration in fact its the only way we could possible describe what its like...its what most of our life is like.

Than I fought for 6-8yrs to get to a better place w/a better life.  & I did it, I'd won, I was living, happy, hopeful, & working toward my future w/all of my dreams seemingly coming true.  Than out of no where Generalized Dystonia started & over a few short years  drive.  Any ways this is gonna change my life in huge ways, its not ideally what I wanted, I wanted Cell service but I can't afford another monthy bill at this point, well I haven't budgetted it yet.  I will be getting one w/in the next month or two to make going out, especially to my 8-10hr Drs apts aren't as painful.  I may just get a Cricket Wi-Fi cell card and use it with my Eee PC.  Eie I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.  Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.  Our new & current primary project: refactoring my life.  1st step getting read for bed then sleeping."

I've also improved when & where get2gnow updat61 the age of updates so now new updates are showing up correctly at the top of the list, I had a bug where I wasn't updated the last update in the list, which corrisponds to the newest update." "I've also improved when get2gnow updates the 'age' of updates so it will update their age even when the TweetList doesn't end up with any new updates." "I also found some issues with my refactoring of my preferences dialog.  These are all fixed and we can all setup our prefernces again.  Sorry about this error l What I still don't get is why it wasn't breaking in more placese.  ~shrug~ whatfore & wherehow.  ;-) yeah, I just wanted to say it, in fact I feel I may have a release name." "*uber-w00t what I've finally figured it out what & why get2gnow was endlessly appending the last new twitter update endlessly & so *uber-w00t\!* I've finally fixed get2gnow's since_id issue.  It was a problem with casting gulong to gfloat.  Once I realized, thnx to many many egreps through get2gnow's debug log,  I've had to refactor my User & UserStatus objects to parse user ids as floats and refactored my OnlineService methods for requesting last update ids to use float values.  I'd already added get & set float methods to my gconf client aspect.  I'm using float values becuase I have very lil doubt that status ids will soon out grow the maximum integer size, especially on smaller machines like netbooks and etc." "I really need to think about using sqlite or something else for storage so I can have something more flexible & platform indipenant - but that's a much longer term goal...well its at least something for my next version." "Now on to stuff some new stuff." "I've refactored, yes again, my debugging aspect.  Its now much more efficiant and has a much lower memory foot print.  I continue to improve my debugging aspect because of how much get2gnow uses this system & how much data is either out put or logged.  So I really want this system to be as advanced as possible." "Thnx to identi.ca's outage at I've also extended support for my networking callback methods.  Now my replacement for libsoup's callback is expected to return a 'void *' & recieves an OnlineServiceWrapper object as its 3rd parameter.  My after soup callback now recieves 2 parameters, 1st is the same OnlineServiceWrapper mentioned above.  It will only 'run' its callback methods once but otherwise all data from the request is accessible to the callback method." "I've also refactored how tweet-list sets its timeout to improve loading speeds.  Now it only calculates timeout seconds when initially loading & setting up the TweetList.  It will recalculate how long to wait between refreshing timelines" "I've also improved its appearance an tooltips by implement SexyTreeView instead of GtkTreeView. I'm still using GtkBuilder files & still using Glade-3 to design my UIs but I've added ex commands as part of make that simply converts 'data/tweet-list.in.ui' to 'data/tweet-list.ui' while converting objects of GtkTreeView class to Sefor parsing the dates of when an update was posted & its age, eg 1, 2, 3, etc seconds, minutes, hours, ago.  As part of that I've fixed all previous issues with how get2gnow was update the 'age' of old updates when new updates are appended to the TweetList.  I was having it use GTK's GtkTreeModelForEachFunc and it just wasn't working so instead I just wrote my own method that updates the dates of al46298865

I've had to store the values in gconf as a string & use strtod when I pull the values out again.  I know its a hack but its the only way to avoid issues that come up when using floats.  For what ever reason float values weren't converted from stings correctly.  It was literally coming up with a completely different value." "I've alo implement libgnome & using GnomProgram.  I've done this for many  future proofing reasons but right now my primary new feaure why I've implemented GnomeProgam right now is to have get2gnow run in 'C' locale, before threading is started, and than to ensure the orginal locale is always reset once get2gnow exits.  This is so multiple date, time, & parting methods are all now thread safe." "Lastly I'm increased the persion of get2gnow sorting and other time / date values used by get2gnow for sorting and time stamping.  Basically I've added a check so now new updates that end up calulating to less than 1 second ago, which can happen, and now when it does get2gnow's sorting value will be set to a minimum of 1 to ensure even the abs newest updates appear in the correct order."

I've done this for many  future proofing reasons but right now my primary new feaure why I've implemented GnomeProgam right now is to have get2gnow run in 'C' locale, before threading is started, and than to ensure the orginal locale is always reset once get2gnow exits.  This is so multiple date, time, & parting methods are all now thread safe." "Lastly I'm increased the persion of get2gnow sorting and other time / date values used by get2gnow for sorting and time stamping.  Basically I've since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.  Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.  Our new & current primary project: refactoring my life.  1st step getting read for bed then sleeping."

"*uber-w00t what I've finally figured it out what & why get2gnow was endlessly appending the last new twitter update endlessly & so *uber-w00t\!* I've finally fixed get2gnow's since_id issue.  It was a problem with casting gulong to gfloat.  Once I realized, thnx to many many egreps through get2gnow's debug log,  I've had to refactor my User & UserStatus objects to parse user ids as floats and refactored my OnlineService methods for requesting last update ids to use float values.  I'd already added get & set float methods to my gconf client aspect.  I'm using float values becuase I have very lil doubt that status ids will soon out grow the maximum integer size, especially on smaller machines like netbooks and etc." "I really need to think about using sqlite or something else for storage so I can have something more flexible & platform indipenant - but that's a much longer term goal...well its at least something for my next version." "Now on to stuff some new stuff." "I've refactored, yes again, my debugging aspect.  Its now much more efficiant and has a much lower memory foot print.  I continue to improve my debugging aspect because of how much get2gnow uses this system & how much data is either out put or logged.  So I really want this system to be as advanced as possible." "Thnx to identi.ca's outage at I've also extended support for my networking callback methods.  Now my replacement for libsoup's callback is expected to return a 'void *' & recieves an OnlineServiceWrapper object as its 3rd parameter.  My after soup callback now recieves 2 parameters, 1st is the same OnlineServiceWrapper mentioned above.  It will only 'run' its callback methods once but otherwise all data from the request is accessible to the callback method." "I've also refactored how tweet-list sets its timeout to improve loading speeds.  Now it only calculates timeout seconds when initially loading & setting up the TweetList.  It will recalculate how long to wait between refreshing timelines" "I've also improved its appearance an tooltips by implement SexyTreeView instead of GtkTreeView.

Than out of no where Generalized Dystonia started & over a few short years despite fighting to hold on to what I could I eventually lost every thing.  And I do truly mean every thing, we lost it all, every possetion, our jobs, our abbility to drive, our apt, our friends, our cats, every thing but us.  After loosing every thing I then found myself even needing a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.  Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.  Our new & current primary project: refactoring my life.  1st step getting read for bed then sleeping."

"After fixing my last bug, my first bug started randomly accuring again.  I've finally resolved the issue by switching from float to double values for update & user ids.  I've had to store the values in gconf as a string & use strtod when I pull the values out again.  I know its a hack but its the only way to avoid issues that come up when using floats.  For what ever reason float values weren't converted from stings correctly.  It was literally coming up with a completely different value." "I've alo implement libgnome & using GnomProgram.  I've done this for many  future proofing reasons but right now my primary new feaure why I've implemented GnomeProgam right now is to have get2gnow run in 'C' locale, before threading is started, and than to ensure the orginal locale is always reset once get2gnow exits.  This is so multiple date, time, & parting methods are all now thread safe." "Lastly I'm increased the persion of get2gnow sorting and other time / date values used by get2gnow for sorting and time stamping.  Basically I've added a check so now new updates that end up calulating to less than 1 second ago, which can happen, and now when it does get2gnow's sorting value will be set to a minimum of 1 to ensure even the abs newest updates appear in the correct order."

"*uber-w00t what I've finally figured it out what & why get2gnow was endlessly appending the last new twitter update endlessly & so *uber-w00t\!* I've finally fixed get2gnow's since_id issue.  It was a problem with casting gulong to gfloat.  Once I realized, thnx to many many egreps through get2gnow's debug log,  I've had to refactor my User & UserStatus objects to parse user ids as floats and refactored my OnlineService methods for requesting last update ids to use float values.  I'd already added get & set float methods to my gconf client aspect.  I'm using float values becuase I have very lil doubt that status ids will soon out grow the maximum integer size, especially on smaller machines like netbooks and etc." "I really need to think about using sqlite or something else for storage so I can have something more flexible & platform indipenant - but that's a much longer term goal...well its at least something for my next version." "Now on to stuff some new stuff." "I've refactored, yes again, my debugging aspect.  Its now much more efficiant and has a much lower memory foot print.  I continue to improve my debugging aspect because of how much get2gnow uses this system & how much data is either out put or logged.  So I really want this system to be as advanced as possible." "Thnx to identi.ca's outage at I've also extended support for my networking callback methods.  Now my replacement for libsoup's callback is expected to return a 'void *' & recieves an OnlineServiceWrapper object as its 3rd parameter.  My after soup callback now recieves 2 parameters, 1st is the same OnlineServiceWrapper mentioned above.  It will only 'run' its callback methods once but otherwise all data from the request is accessible to the callback method." "I've also refactored how tweet-list sets its timeout to improve loading speeds.  Now it only calculates timeout seconds when initially loading & setting up the TweetList.  It will recalculate how long to wait between refreshing timelines" "I've also improved its appearance an tooltips by implement SexyTreeView instead of GtkTreeView. I'm still using GtkBuilder files & still using Glade-3 to design my UIs but I've added ex commands as part of make that simply converts 'data/tweet-list.in.ui' to 'data/tweet-list.ui' while converting objects of GtkTreeView class to Sefor parsing the dates of when an update was posted & its age, eg 1, 2, 3, etc seconds, minutes, hours, ago.

Its a gconf sync issue, gconf client itsn't saving the newest id correctly for timelines & replies.  So it was appending the latest update over & over & over & over & over & over & over & again..." "& yes I want to keep typing over & over - over & over.  Its almost as annoying as the bug felt, but not as annoying as the fix.  I do know its fixed: finally, fully, & completely.  What I still don't get is why it wasn't breaking in more placese.  ~shrug~ whatfore & wherehow.  ;-) yeah, I just wanted to say it, in fact I feel I may have a release name." "*uber-w00t what I've finally figured it out what & why get2gnow was endlessly appending the last new twitter update endlessly & so *uber-w00t\!* I've finally fixed get2gnow's since_id issue.  It was a problem with casting gulong to gfloat.  Once I realized, thnx to many many egreps through get2gnow's debug log,  I've had to refactor my User & UserStatus objects to plife again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this egrep '(Updat|Process|Sav|Getting|Setting|Loaded|Refreshed|Requesting).*twitter.com.*(friends|replies|direct).*ew.*float.*' the correct order."

Than I fought for 6-8yrs to get to a better place w/a better life.  & I did it, I'd won, I was living, happy, hopeful, & working toward my future w/all of my dreams seemingly coming true.  Than out of no where Generalized Dystonia started & over a few short years despite fighting to hold on to what I could I eventually lost every thing.  And I do truly mean every thing, we lost it all, every possetion, our jobs, our abbility to drive, our apt, our friends, our cats, every thing but us.  After loosing every thing I then found myself even needing a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.  Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.  Our new & current primary project: refactoring my life.  1st step getting read for bed then sleeping."

"*uber-w00t what I've finally figured it out what & why get2gnow was endlessly appending the last new twitter update endlessly & so *uber-w00t\!* I've finally fixed get2gnow's since_id issue.  It was a problem with casting gulong to gfloat.  Once I realized, thnx to many many egreps through get2gnow's debug log,  I've had to refactor my User & UserStatus objects to parse user ids as floats and refactored my OnlineService methods for requesting last update ids to use float values.  I'd already added get & set float methods to my gconf client aspect.  I'm using float values becuase I have very lil doubt that status ids will soon out grow the maximum integer size, especially on smaller machines like netbooks and etc." "I really need to think about using sqlite or something else for storage so I can have something more flexible & platform indipenant - but that's a much longer term goal...well its at least something for my next version."

I continue to improve my debugging aspect because of how much get2gnow uses this system & how much data is either out put or logged.  So I really want this system to be as advanced as possible."

Now my replacement for libsoup's callback is expected to return a 'void *' & recieves an OnlineServiceWrapper object as its 3rd parameter.  My after soup callback now recieves 2 parameters, 1st is the same OnlineServiceWrapper mentioned above.  It will only 'run' its callback methods once but otherwise all data from the request is accessible to the callback method." "I've also refactored how tweet-list sets its timeout to improve loading speeds.  Now it only calculates timeout seconds when initially loading & setting up the TweetList.  It will recalculate how long to wait between refreshing timelines" "I've also improved its appearance an tooltips by implement SexyTreeView instead of GtkTreeView. I'm still using GtkBuilder files & still using Glade-3 to design my UIs but I've added ex commands as part of make that simply converts 'data/tweet-list.in.ui' to 'data/tweet-list.ui' while converting objects of GtkTreeView class to Sefor parsing the dates of when an update was posted & its age, eg 1, 2, 3, etc seconds, minutes, hours, ago.

After loosing every thing I then found myself even needing a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.

As part of that I've fixed all previous issues with how get2gnow was update the 'age' of old updates when new updates are appenly & completely fixed my many times aforementioned issues with get2gnow appending twitter's latest update id over & over.

And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.  Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.  Our new & current primary project: refactoring my life.  1st step getting read for bed then sleeping."

I've finally resolved the issue by switching from float to double values for update & user ids.  I've had to store the values in gconf as a string & use strtod when I pull the values out again.  I know its a hack but its the only way to avoid issues that come up when using floats.  For what ever reason fale is always reset once get2gnow exits.  This is so multiple date, time, & parting methods are all nowes.  The reason I've done this is so that when update the age of updates old update will have already been removed & so update update ages is quicker, I know its a no duh kinda improvement, but  in huge ways, its not ideally what I wanted, I wanted Cell service but I can't afford another monthy bill at this pI'm using float values becuase I have very lil doubt that status ids will soon out grow the maximum integer size, especially on smaller machines like netbooks and etc." "I really need to think about using sqlite or something else for storage so I can have something more flexible & platform indipenant - but that's a much longer term goal...well its at least something for my next version." "Now on to stuff some new stuff." "I've refactored, yes again, my debugging aspect.  Its now much more efficiant and has a much lower memory foot print.  I continue to improve my debugging aspect because of how much get2gnow uses this system & how much data is either out put or logged.  So I really want this system to be as advanced as possible."

Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.  Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.  Our new & current primary project: refactoring my life.  1st step getting read for bed then sleeping."

After loosing every thing I then found myself even needing a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.

Any ways this is gonna change my life in huge ways, its not ideally what I wanted, I wanted Cell service but I can't afford another monthy bill at this point, well I haven't budgetted it yet.  I will be getting one w/in the next month or two to make going out, especially to my 8-10hr Drs apts aren't as painful.  I may just get a Cricket Wi-Fi cell card and use it with my Eee PC.

Than out of no where Generalized Dystonia started & over a few short years despite fighting to hold on to what I could I eventually ls a hack but its the only way to avoid issues that come up when using floats.  For what ever reason float values weren't converted from stings correctly.  It was literally coming up with a completely different value." "I've alo implement libgnome & using GnomProgram.  I've done this for many  future proofing reasons but right now my primary new feaure why I've implemented GnomeProgam right now is to have get2gnow run in 'C' locale, before threading is started, and than to ensure the orginal locale is always reset once get2gnow exits.  This is so multiple date, time, & parting methods are all now thread safe." "Lastly I'm increased the persion of get2gnow sorting and other time / date values used by get2gnow for sorting and time stamping.  Basically I've added a check so now new updates that end up calulating to less than 1 second ago, which can happen, and now when it does get2gnow's sorting value will be set to a minimum of 1 to ensure even the abs newest updates appear in the correct order."

ethod." "I've also refactored how tweet-list sets its timeout to improve loading speeds.  Now it only calculates timeout seconds when initially loading & setting up the TweetList.  It will recalculate how long to wait between refreshing timelines" "I've also improved its appearance an tooltips by implement SexyTreeView instead of GtkTreeView. I'm still using GtkBuilder files & still using Glade-3 to design my UIs but I've added ex commands as part of make that simply converts 'data/tweet-list.in.ui' to 'data/tweet-list.ui' while converting objects of GtkTreeView class to SexyTreeView.  I plan on implementin this in all of my GtkBuilder ui files, but for now its just implemented on in TweetList." "I've also improve my date method for parsing the dates of when an update was posted & its age, eg 1, 2, 3, etc seconds, minutes, hours, ago.  As part of that I've fixed all previous issues with how get2gnow was update the 'age' of old updates when new updates are appended to the TweetList.  I was having it use GTK's GtkTreeModelForEachFunc and it just wasn't working so instead I just wrote my own method that updates the dates of all entries in the list store."

eeding a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.  Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.  Our new & current primary project: refactoring my life.  1st step getting read for bed then sleeping."

Which is an istruction set for periods of pure hell & that's not an exaggeration in fact its the only way we could possible describe what its like...its what most of our life is like.

Than I fought for 6-8yrs to get to a better place w/a better life.  & I did it, I'd won, I was living, happy, hopeful, & working toward my future w/all of my dreams seemingly coming true.

I've done this for many  future proofing reasons but right now my primary new feaure why I've implemented GnomeProgam right now is to have get2gnow run in 'C' locale, before threading is started, and than to ensure the orginal locale is always reset once get2gnow exits.  This is so multiple date, time, & parting methods are all now thread safe." "Lastly I'm increased the persion of get2gnow sorting and other time / date values used by get2gnow for sorting and time stamping.  Basically I've added a check so now new updates that end up calulating to less than 1 second ago, which can happen, and now when it does get2gnow's sorting value will be set to a minimum of 1 to ensure even the abs newest updates appear in the correct order."

"Oh yeah uber coolness note, its gonna make me hella tight come next month & prolly into Sept, but it was def w/o any doubt 100% worth it.  I've order my own Asus Eee PC 700 [bright pink] with Linux pre-installed, w00t, I also bought a beautiful pink carrying case and an additional 4GB Micro-SD card, to use as its primary HD to minimize writes to my Eee PC's SD drive.  Any ways this is gonna change my life in huge ways, its not ideally what I wanted, I wanted Cell service but I can't afford another monthy bill at this point, well I haven't budgettel entries in the list store."

This is so multiple date, time, & parting methods are all now thread safe." "Lastly I'm increased the persion of get2gnow sorting and other time / date values used by get2gnow for sorting and time stamping.  Basically I've added a check so now new updates that end up calulating to less than 1 second ago, which can happen, and now when it does get2gnow's sorting value will be set to a minimum of 1 to ensure even the abs newest updates appear in the correct order."

Once I realized, thnx to many many egreps through get2gnow's debug log,  I've had to refactor my User & UserStatus objects to parse user ids as floats and refactored my OnlineService methods for requesting last update ids to use float values.  I'd already added get & set float methods to my gconf client aspect.  I'm using float values becuase I have very lil doubt that status ids will soon out grow the maximum integer size, especially on smaller machines like netbooks and etc." "I really need to think about using sqlite or something else for storage so I can have something more flexible & platform indipenant - but that's a much longer term goal...well its at least something for my next version." "Now on to stuff some new stuff." "I've refactored, yes again, my debugging aspect.  Its now much more efficiant and has a much lower memory foot print.  I continue to improve my debugging aspect because of how much get2gnow uses this system & how much data is either out put or logged.  So I really want this system to be as advanced as possible." "Thnx to identi.ca's outage at I've also extended support for my networking callback methods.  Now my replacement for libsoup's callback is expected to return a 'void *' & recieves an OnlineServiceWrapper object as its 3rd parameter.  My after soup callback now recieves 2 parameters, 1st is the same OnlineServiceWrapper mentioned above.  It will only 'run' its callback methods once but otherwise all data from the request is accessible to the callback method." "I've also refactored how tweet-list sets its timeout to improve loading speeds.  Now it only calculates timeout seconds when initially loading & setting up the TweetList.  It will recalculate how long to wait between refreshing timelines" "I've also improved its appearance an tooltips by implement SexyTreeView instead of GtkTreeView. I'm still using GtkBuilder files & still using Glade-3 to design my UIs but I've added ex commands as part of make that simply converts 'data/tweet-list.in.ui' to 'data/tweet-list.ui' while converting objects of GtkTreeView class to SexyTreeView.

It was a problem with casting gulong to gfloat.  Once I realized, thnx to many many egreps through get2gnow's debug log,  I've had to refactor my User & UserStatus objects to parse user ids as floats and refactored my OnlineService methods for requesting last update ids to use float values.  I'd already added get & set float methods to my gconf client aspect.  I'm using float values becuase I have very lil doubt that status ids will soon out grow the maximum integer size, especially on smaller machines like netbooks and etc." "I really need to think about using sqlite or something else for storage so I can have something more flexible & platform indipenant - but that's a much longer term goal...well its at least something for my next version." "Now on to stuff some new stuff." "I've refactored, yes again, my debugging aspect.  Its now much more efficiant and has a much lower memory foot print.  I continue to improve my debugging aspect because of how much get2gnow uses this system & how much data is either out put or logged.  So I really want this system to be as advanced as possible." "Thnx to identi.ca's outage at I've also extended support for my networking callback methods.  Now my replacement for libsoup's callback is expected to return a 'void *' & recieves an OnlineServiceWrapper object as its 3rd parameter.  My after soup callback now recieves 2 parameters, 1st is the same OnlineServiceWrapper mentioned above.  It will only 'run' its callback methods once but otherwise all data from the request is accessible to the callback method." "I've also refactored how tweet-list sets its timeout to improve loading speeds.  Now it only calculates timeout seconds when initially loading & setting up the TweetList.  It will recalculate how long to wait between refreshing timelines" "I've also improved its appearance an tooltips by implement SexyTreeView instead of GtkTreeView. I'm still using GtkBuilder files & still using Glade-3 to design my UIs but I've added ex commands as part of make that simply converts 'data/tweet-list.in.ui' to 'data/tweet-list.ui' while converting objects of GtkTreeView class to Sefor parsing the dates of when an update was posted & its age, eg 1, 2, 3, etc seconds, minutes, hours, ago.

"After fixing my last bug, my first bug started randomly accuring again.  I've finally resolved the issue by switchi and other time / date values used by get2gnow for sorting and time stamping.  Basically I've added a check so now new updates that end up calulating to less than 1 second ago, which can happen, and now when it does get2gnow's sortinting value will be set to a minimum of 1 to ensure even the abs newest updates appear in the correct order."

Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.  Our new & current primary project: refactoring my life.  1st step getting read for bed then sleeping."

y macro 'gdouble_to_str'." "There, no all shiny, all done, & now I he new gdouble values as strings.  I've created a method to drop precision from a gdouble value and than returns its value, w/o zeros, as a gchar *.  My function is called 'program_drop_precision' but its intended to be called using my macro 'gdouble_to_str'." "There, no all shiny, all done, & now I disconnect from this world of 0s & 1s to go back to my life of one...oh my oh my what fun." "Oh yeah uber coolness note, its gonna make me hella tight come next month & prolly into Sept, but it was def w/o any doubt 100%% worth it.  I've ok] with Linux pre-installed, w00t, I also bought a beautiful pink carrying case and an additional 4GB Micro-SD card, to use as its primary HD to minimize writes to my Eee PC's SD drive.  Any ways this is gonna change my life in huge ways, its not ideally what I wanted, I wanted Cell service but I can't afford another monthy bill at this point, well I haven't budgetted it yet.  I will be getting one w/in the next month or two to make going out, especially to my 8-10hr Drs apts aren't as painful.  I may just get a Cricket Wi-Fi cell card and use it with my Eee PC.  Either way I'll no longer have to be in my bed to feel connected.  Even though my only computer is my laptop I don't have enough control & dexterity to move my laptop around w/o it breaking its HD.  I've tried but I just tremor & spasm to much." "Now I'm just giddily waiting & giddily working again.  I'll soon no longer feel afraid to leave my bed, I can't.  As for why I've felt afraid to leave my bed well afraid isn't the right word, its that how alone I am really hits home then.  The worst part is that we're left w/no distrattions, noise, or company, only our thoughts & memories.  Which is an istruction set for periods of pure hell & that's not an exaggeration in fact its the only way we could possible describe what its like...its what most of our life is like.  But it is getting better..." "Its bizarre, life was hell for so long just pure hell.  Than I fought for 6-8yrs to get to a better place w/a better life.  & I did it, I'd won, I was living, happy, hopeful, & working toward my future w/all of my dreams seemingly coming true.  Than out of no where Generalized Dystonia started & over a few short years  drive.  Any ways this is gonna change my life in huge ways, its not ideally what I wanted, I wanted Cell service but I can't afford another monthy bill at this point, well I haven't budgetted it yet.  I will be getting one w/in the next month or two to make going out, especially to my 8-10hr Drs apts aren't as painful.  I may just get a Cricket Wi-Fi cell card and use it with my Eee PC.  Eie I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.  Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.

git:commit+push+sync "get2gnow #00EEECaC2 - final features froze & under creation" "I'm continuing to chip away at adding caching support, w/o breaking anything LOL.  Right now there are some issues with building cache file names in a way that they can easily be clean-up.  This will be easy to resolve but since its really a shiny *final touch* kinda fix, well I wanna save it until right before I'm ready for release."  "Other wise I'm adding my two final features.  1st is just a list store / combo box combination that gives you access to your last 50 tweets.  I'll be making that into a preference but for now its just a constant." "My bigger, better, & 'has me giddy' new feature is my 'best friends' list view.  I've added a widget to the selected tweet area that let's you mark someone you're following as a 'best friend'. When they post a new update, since the last time you loaded get2gnow, their name appears in bold in the 'best friends updates' list. Clicking on their name opens a new tab an displaying their updates. But my fave part of this feature is my new 'best friends' tab which is just another TweetView but instead of displaying a timeline it displays your 'best friends' most recent updates." "I've also changed how maximum & minimum tweets are displayed for DMs, Replies, and 'Best Friends'.  All DMs & Replies are loaded when get2gnow starts, which I need to fix w/a preference so they're limited to say 'Show me replies from the last 1-14day' & 'Show me my Direct Messages from the last 1-7 days, 3-4 weeks, or 1-3months.  I'm still working on my 'best friends' feature, so for now its currently disabled.  I prolly have it working by the time I make my next commit...whenever that turns out to be." "No day turns out how I expect...so I expect nothing from any day & only hope to soon stop not expecting...or to have something that I've gotten used, maybe even gotten used to something that doesn't suck.  Though I don't care either so long as I stop expecting any thing, stop hoping for any thing, & either stop caring or stop having 'the ability' to care.  I.e. yes that means existing." "One cannot regret what one never expects - but one can still wish it never was.  I *have* to stop hoping, regretting, expecting, & even wishing for any thing better than 40-60yrs alone...totally alone.  I have to face, even it sounds like a worse case, scenaerio, its my most likely future & I have to find someway to be okey w/that truth."

git:commit+push+sync --append "I've also revamped how hotkeys are bound to get2gnow various areas within its 'TweetView'.  I'm now using a const list of objects, they're pulled from the GtkBuilderUI than 'tweets_hotkey' is bound to all of the 'container' objects/widgets.  I've done this so hopefully no matter what has the focus key board shortcuts will still work, even though I am already attepting to keep or return focus to TweetView's 'sexy entry'." "Speaking of which, I've expanded TweetView's 'update entry' so its now embed in a GtkComboBoxEntry which no saves up 50 previous updates.  They can be selected, edited, resent, & etc." "I've also done a ton more work on imlementing my 'Best Friends' feature.  Its a big update & I'm trying not to over due it.  So it'll take me a while to finish this feature.  Along with finishing support for Twitter's search & Laconica's groups." "I just can't keep beating my self up to finish a new feature." "I have so much more I want to write...but I can't, not today & especially not right now.  I'm hella lucky to have found done any thing today as is." "Oh yeah, one last note: get2gnow now has its own bugzilla page, special thnx to GNOME Live.  Goodness I love them.  Any ways my bugzilla page is now ready.  I'll add it to configure & compile it into get2gnow with my next commit." "I'm so beat for tonight."

s.  This is so multiple date, is an istruction set for periods of pure hell & that's not an exaggeration in fact its the only way we could possible describe what its like...its what most of our life is like.  But it is getting better..." "Its bizarre, life was hell for so long just pure hell.  Than I fought for 6-8yrs to get to a better place w/a better life.  & I did it, I'd won, I was living, happy, hopeful, & working toward my future w/all of my dreams seemingly coming true.  Than out of no where Generalized Dystonia started & over a few short years despite fighting to hold on to what I could I eventually lost every thing.  And I do truly mean every thing, we lost it all, every possetion, our jobs, our abbility to drive, our apt, our friends, our cats, every thing but us.  After loosing every thing I then found myself even needing a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting like hell again.  I'll have to do it every day & forever, but I'm ready.  So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.  Now's our time to get beck to our lives, to get back to my life, to start getting thing back, putting them together, & to start living...once again.  Our new & current primary project: refactoring my life.  1st step getting read for bed then sleeping."

"I've improved how get2gnow appends new updates, by having it prepend them instead.  I've also improved when & where get2gnow updat61 the age of updates so now new updates are showing up correctly at the top of the list, I had a bug where I wasn't updated the last update in the list, which corrisponds to the newest update." "I've also improved when get2gnow updates the 'age' of updates so it will update their age even when the TweetList doesn't end up with any new updates." "I also found some issues with my refactoring of my preferences dialog.  These are all fixed and we can all setup our prefernces again.  Sorry about this error lasting so long, wait no I'm not sorry at all, if you're having problemsly, by changing status & user ids to be floats instead of gulong.  Now that I've removed this conintue check *all* new updates are prendend to the tweet-list not just the newest one." "I've also remove uri parsing from get2gnow's online_service_update_ids_(set|get) methods & now its only parsed by the parser.  It makes get2gnow faster for 2 reasons: it only has to parse the uri once per timeline & not when loading IDs & again while saving IDs." "I've also made a slight change in the order in which get2gnow cleans up old updates from the TweetList & than updates the age of the updates.  The reason I've done this is so that when update the age of updates old update will have already been removed & so update update ages is quicker, I know its a no duh kinda improvement, but how drast the improvements are witgit:commit+push+sync "get2gnow #0000ECaFC - ...abunch more...for later..." "After fixing my last bug, my first bug started randomly accuring again.  I've finally resolved the issue by switching from float to double values for update & user ids.  I've had to store the values in gconf as a string & use strtod when I pull the values out again.  I know its a hack but its the only way to avoid issues that come up when using floats.  For what ever reason float values weren't converted from stings correctly.  It was literally coming up with a completely different value." "I've alo implement libgnome & using GnomProgram.  I've done this for many  future proofing reasons but right now my primary new feaure why I've implemented GnomeProgam right now is to have get2gnow run in 'C' locale, before threading is started, and than to ensure the orginal locale is always reset once get2gnow exits.  This is so multiple date, time, & parting methods are all now thread safe." "Lastly I'm increased the persion of get2gnow sorting and other time / date values used by get2gnow for sorting and time stamping.  Basically I've added a check so now new updates that end up calulating to less than 1 second ago, which can happen, and now when it does get2gnow's sorting value will be set to a minimum of 1 to ensure even the abs newest updates appear in the correct order." "Lastly, I've update 'SelectedTweet' actions, line star'ing, unstar'ing, following, & etc to use gdouble values as well.  Now all of those actions are working again." "A note reguarding using the new gdouble values as strings.  I've created a method to drop precision from a gdouble value and than returns its value, w/o zeros, as a gchar *.  My function is called 'program_drop_precision' but its intended to be called using my macro 'gdouble_to_str'." "There, no all shiny, all done, & now I disconnect from this world of 0s & 1s to go back to my life of one...oh my oh my what fun." "Oh yeah uber coolness note, its gonna make me hella tight come next month & prolly into Sept, but it was def w/o any doubt 100% worth it.  I've order my own Asus Eee PC 700 [bright pink] with Linux pre-installed, w00t, I also bought a beautiful pink carrying case and an additional 4GB Micro-SD card, to use as its primary HD to minimize writes to my Eee PC's SD drive.  Any ways this is gonna change my life in huge ways, its not ideally what I wanted, I wanted Cell service but I can't afford another monthy bill at this point, well I haven't budgetted it yet.  I will be getting one w/in the next month or two to make going out, especially to my 8-10hr Drs apts aren't as painful.  I may just get a Cricket Wi-Fi cell card and use it with my Eee PC.  Either way I'll no longer have to be in my bed to feel connected.  Even though my only computer is my laptop I don't have enough control & dexterity to move my laptop around w/o it breaking its HD. ages is quicker, I know its a no duh kinda improvement, but how drast the improvements are with just changing the order of when methods are called is a beautiful example for artistic programming."

The reason I've done this is so that when update the age of updates old update will have already been removed & so update update ages is quicker, I know its a no duh kinda improvement, but how drast the improvements are witgit:commit+push+sync "get2gnow #0000ECaFC - ...abunch more...for later..." "After fixing my last bug, my first bug started randomly accuring again.  I've finally resolved the issue by switching from float to double values for update & user ids.  I've had to store the values in gconf as a string & use strtod when I pull the values out again.  I know its a hack but its the only way to avoid issues that come up when using floats.  For what ever reason float values weren't converted from stings correctly.  It was literally coming up with a completely different value." "I've alo implement libgnomeompletely different value." "I've alo implement libgnome & using GnomProgram.  I've done this for many  future proofing reasons but right now my primary new feaure why I've implemented GnomeProgam right now is to have get2gnow run in 'C' locale, before threading is started, and than to ensure the orginal locale is always reset once get2gnow exits.  This is so multiple date, time, & parting methods are all now thread safe." "Lastly I'm increased the persion of get2gnow sorting and other time / date values used by get2gnow for sorting and time stamping.  Basically I've added a check so now new updates that end up calulating to less than 1 second ago, which can happen, and now when it does get2gnow's sorting value will be set to a minimum of 1 to ensure even the abs newest updates appear in the correct order." "Lastly, I've update Lastly, I've update 'SelectedTweet' actions, line star'ing, unstar'ing, following, & etc to use gdouble values as well.  Now all of those actions are working again."

"*uber-w00t what I've finally figured it out what & why get2gnow was endlessly appending the last new twitter update endlessly & so *uber-w00t\!* I've finally fixed get2gnow's since_id issue.  It was a problem with casting gulong to gfloat.  Once I realized, thnx to many many egreps through get2gnow's debug log,  I've had to refactor my User & UserStatus objects to parse user ids as floats and refactored my OnlineService methods for requesting last update ids to use float values.  I'd already added get & set float methods to my gconf client aspect.  I'm using float values becuase I have very lil doubt that status ids will soon out grow the maximum integer size, especially on smaller machines like netbooks and etc." "I really need to think about using sqlite or something else for storage so I can have something more flexible & platform indipenant - but that's a much longer term goal...well its at least something for my next version." "Now on to stuff some new stuff." "I've refactored, yes again, my debugging aspect.  Its now much more efficiant and has a much lower memory foot print.  I continue to improve my debugging aspect because of ant this system to be as advanced as possible." "Thnx to identi.ca's outage at I've also extended support for my networking callback methods.  Now my replacement for libsoup's callback is expected to return a 'void *' & recieves an OnlineServiceWrapper object as its 3rd parameter.  My after soup callback now recieves 2 parameters, 1st is the same OnlineServiceWrapper mentioned above.  It will only 'run' its callback methods once but otherwise all data from the request is accessible to the callback method." "I've also refactored how tweet-list sets its timeout to improve loading speeds.  Now it only calculates timeout seconds when initially loading & setting up the TweetList.  It will recalculate how long to wait between refreshing timelines" "I've also improved its appearance an tooltips by implement SexyTreeView instead of GtkTreeView. I'm still using GtkBuilder files & still using Glade-3 to design my UIs but I've added ex commands as part of make that simply converts 'data/tweet-list.in.ui' to 'data/tweet-list.ui' while converting objects of GtkTreeView class to SexyTreeView.  I plan on implementin this in all of my GtkBuilder ui files, but for now its just implemented on in TweetList." "I've also improve my date method for parsing the dates of when an update was posted & its age, eg 1, 2, 3, etc seconds, minutes, hours, ago.  As part of that I've fixed all previous issues with how get2gnow was update the 'age' of old updates when new updates are appended to the TweetList.  I was having it use GTK's GtkTreeModelForEachFunc and it just wasn't working so instead I just wrote my own method that updates the dates of al46298865

git:commit+push+sync "get2gnow #00EEECaC3 @ 2009-07-27.01" "I've fixed the problems with preferences dialog crashing get2gnow. LOL it turn out it was all just do to a missing 'e' in one of my GtkBuilder UI files. Now all is well.  This bug was created by making what get's replaced when one enters '/me' in their updates.  It can now be replaced with nothing, one's user name/login, or one's nick name - this is what the user has saved(on Twitter.Com, Identi.Ca, or etc) as their 'display/nick name'.  This is retrieved and set during the login process by requesting & parsing the user's profile xml.  This is part of my extended libsoup callback support." "I've also done more work on my best friends feature, though very lil.  I have sadly very lil new in this update, mostly just bug fixes & artistic improvements." "I've been lacking any inspiration for a while.  Mostly because I've had to be honest w/myself and face just how much my Generalized Dystonia effects me & just how much more work its for me to truly take care of myself.  And I was highly unsatisfied with how I was taking care of myself which sent me into about two to six weeks of deep depression." "I'm still climbing out of that pit of dispare...well honestly I'm still at the bottom, but I've gotten up & I'm ready to try to start climbing again w/the intent of finding something more." "My 'something more' is primarily game programming & even more so 'getting out' more.  Especially to local meet-ups or any thing else that I'll be able to - as I take better care of myself, and that now sadly includes accepting what Generalized Dystonia does to me & what I have to do to deal with it & to, each day, recover from what its done." "I'm aiming for a better quality of life.  That also includes getting in to see more specialist and focusing on hiring more PCAs(primary care attendants).  This is also taking up much of my time & even more of my energy, especially emotionally." "With each email to a care taker I have to accept & write in detail just how much help I now need.  Which is basically several paragraphs full of reminders of what I feel I've lost due to Generalized Dystonia.  Its a constant reminder of what I can't do w/no focus on what I can.  Its obviously draining me emotionally & mentally leaving me either inspirationaless or w/o the motivation to try to do what I can.  Because, as irration as it may seem & indeed probably is, it matters lil how irrational any thing is when w/each email I'm left feeling like I can't do anything.  Even though there are things that I can do & indeed they are things I'm very able to do, I'm very good at doing, & thing that can make a difference.  I "\""simply"\"" have to find some way to keep that in mind while still be detailed enough in my needs from my Drs & PCAs so as to get what care I need." "Now my last lil bit of news on new & improved features in get2gnow, my lil attempt to increase my brain's dopame and/or seratonine levels to help me sleep & mainly to help me get my mood back to where I was feeling prior to reflecting on my hows & whys." "So lastly I've done more work on improve my extended libsexy SexyLabel.  Especially when it comes to rendering updates with multiple urls in them.  I haven't refactored it yet though for one primary reason: I won't be...I'll be replacing it, ha! gotch'ya :-) (I know, prolly not).  I'll actually be replacing it, with an implementation of libxul - yeah full support.  I'm doing this to allow for a much improved & gorgious display.  I'm also working toward replacing or extending GTK+ as get2gnow's primary UI toolkit.  I'm thinking of integrating more of Cairo's functionality or possibly switching to a different UI backend such as pigment, librsvga, clutter, or maybe just libxul using Canvas & XSLT & more, including faster xml parsing - though these are all experimental ideas and will depend on the performance more than any thing.  But regardless of what I use get2gnow's getting a major UI over hall." "From here forward I'm making no comprimises on any project.  Thus my refocus toward game programming, my web app's complete rebuild, & a lot of my personal disappointment with even uber successes with get2gnow & connectED.  One note about connectED: its busted & really needs fixed, actually most of its code sucks & it needs rewrote which I'm not doing.  So I'll be doing a hard reset & checkout getting back to a workable & usable state.  Work may or may not continue but if it does it will be slow becuase I refuse to create a comprimized IDE even if it is for PHP & Web Dev which I do almost nil of any more.  So its a may be viewed as dead, I'm unsure.  I hate to abandon any project - but I hate connectED's code even more.  Its poor, ugly, & missing the old Glade file which where used to create its UI so switch to GtkBuilder would be a giant pain in my ass.  However it would give me a 'working' project to work from & truly turn the idea of what an IDE can do & can be on its head." "So yeah I have a lot of work ahead of me - but I have only one roadmap: to see where I am next year.  July 27th, 2010 - yep as of today every things get re-thought, reworked, & a tons getting scrapped.  get2gnow will become a truly beautiful micro-blogging client though most of my code will be gone by my next version, LOL which will still be its 1st, terminal-hackGirls will be a major play ground as will Alacast.  Though most of my time, yes from today forward will be focused on Game Creation." "To myself: welcome to being free to do what you want - how you want - release early & release often is dead - I can & will strive for perfection, shiny, & ~*wow*~ - *shiny* is *shiny* - now go forth & amaze yourself!" "If one amazes themselves they change the world if only for those who see the world through similar perspectives as I do - which are those who I care about most.  There's no "\""blue sky"\"" so thinking past it can't be bad, nor a limit, nor should one aim for the starts chances are they've already burnt out or at least they will be once I could reach them - or I would be." "Don't try to change the world.  Find what awakens you than go forth and do it.  What the world needs is awakened people."

So we're now deciding to start re-building & to fight the good fight.

Than I fought for 6-8yrs to get to a better place w/a better life.  & I did it, I'd won, I was living, happy, hopeful, & working toward my future w/all of my dreams seemingly coming true.  Than out of no where Generalized Dystonia started & over a few short years despite fighting to hold on to what I could I eventually lost every thing.  And I do truly mean every thing, we lost it all, every possetion, our jobs, our abbility to drive, our apt, our friends, our cats, every thing but us.  After loosing every thing I then found myself even needing a care taker, and yes I truly need my PCAs.  Its weird, only as I'm writing am I realizing something.  In November of 2007 I went in for the last procedure that, for us, had offerred any hope.  Well whe it didn't help - it didn't work.  And since than I've stopped trying to get any thing back, I've stopped trying to build my life again, I'd stopped hoping.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of loosing every thing all over again but still being left alive.  Loosing every thing expect sufferring is trying worse than death.  Its not a whole I want to ever fall back down, of course I'll have to crawl out 1st.  Well its only writing this that I've gained this insight on why I feel how I feel.  And now knowing it, understanding it, well I'm ready to start fighting likets age, eg 1, 2, 3, etc seconds, minutes, hours, ago.  As part of that I've fixed all previous issues with how get2gnow was update the 'age' of old updates when new updates are appended to the TweetList.  I was having it use GTK's GtkTreeModelForEachFunc and it just wasn't working so instead I just wrote my own method that updates the dates of al46298865

Now my replacement for libsoup's callback is expected to return a 'void *' & recieves an OnlineServiceWrapper object as its 3rd parameter.  My after soup callback now recieves 2 parameters, 1st is the same OnlineServiceWrapper mentioned above.  It will only 'run' its callback methods once but otherwise all data from the request is accessible to the callback method." "I've also refactored how tweet-list sets its timeout to improve loading speeds.  Now it only calculates timeout seconds when initially loading & setting up the TweetList.  It will recalculate how long to wait between refreshing timelines" "I've also improved its appearance an tooltips by implement SexyTreeView inste& over.

"*uber-w00t what I've finally figured it out what & why get2gnow was endlessly appending the last new twitter update endlessly & so *uber-w00t\!* I've finally fixed get2gnow's since_id issue.  It was a problem with casting gulong to gfloat.  Once I realized, thnx to many many egreps through get2gnow's debug log,  I've had to refactor my User & UserStatus objects to parse user ids as floats and refactored my OnlineService methods for requesting last update ids to use float values.  I'd already added get & set float methods to my gconf client aspect.  I'm using float values becuase I have very lil doubt that status ids will soon out grow the maximum integer size, especially on smaller machines like netbooks and etc." "I really need to think about using sqlite or something else for storage so I can have something more flexible & platform indipenant - but that's a much longer term goal...well its at least something for my next version."

I've done this for many  future proofing reasons but right now my primary new feaure why I've implemented GnomeProgam right now is to have get2gnow run in 'C' locale, before threading is started, and than to ensure the orginal locale is always reset once get2gnow exits.  This is so multiple date, time, & parting methods are all now thread safe." "Lastly I'm increased the persion of get2gnow sorting and other time / date values used by get2gnow for sorting and time stamping.  Basically I've added a check so now new updates that end up calulating to less than 1 second ago, which can happen, and now when it does get2gnow's sorting value will be set to a minimum of 1 to ensure even the abs newest updates appear in the correct order."
